Leeser essay

Having made 5 presentations this semester, about a series of architects progressing from the end of the 19th century to the end of the 20th, my assignment for this essay is to summarize my research about these five architects.

The most straightforward approach is to simply write five separate essays about these men (as it happens, they are all men.) This seems like a waste of my time and yours. 

A second approach is to find common threads that unite these five architects, different subjects that pertain to some or all of them, and write a series of separate essays. This seems more desirable, but somewhat arbitrary. This arbitrariness may be good or bad - to simply mix a bunch of ideas in a blender and see what comes out is a somewhat exciting approach to architectural criticism.

A third approach might be to look at them historically. Loos -> Taut -> Fuller -> Price (?) -> ??  

To imagine that there is a direct progression between these men even if there is none. Alternatively we might go in reverse. How did Price influence Fuller? How did Fuller influence Loos? He didn't, but how might he have? This is maybe similar to Rowe's imaginary criticism of whats-his-name (the english guy...)

A fourth approach, the one I'm going to start with, is to just head off in a direction and see what happens. So let's call this the introduction, and move on to Adolf Loos.


### Adolf Loos


### Bruno Taut


### Buckminster Fuller
