This course is about applying architectural history to our own contemporary (or future) practice. This paper is an extension of that. 

Throughout the semester I have presented the work of five architects - Adolf Loos, Bruno Taut, Bucky Fuller, (Cedric Price), (????) - and attempted to draw parallels between their lives and works to our modern experiences.

In this paper, I will attempt to apply these lessons of these men to three subjects of particular interest to me - technology, nature, and architectural practice itself.

In some sense, the format seems strange and random - although I had some role in choosing these architects, they were also predetermined by the vagaries of the syllabus. They do not necessarily have any inherent connection to each other, there is not a clear progression of thought or practice between them. Although in some sense this approach seems random, it is also exciting to attempt to discover common threads between unrelated actors. I am in particular inspired by Colin Rowe's work on symmetry connecting Le Corbusier and Palladio.

#### Technology

Although Modernism may have overstated its break with the past, it is clear that the technological transformations of the Industrial Revolution have caused massive transformations in the practice of architecture. 

Technology has been the dominant theme of my time at Pratt, and is perhaps the dominant idea in current architectural theory. Postmodernism and critical theory have receded, and no large philosophical ideas have emerged to take their place, as architecture has spent the last ten (more?) years struggling to integrate the dramatic changes that the computer has and continues to apply to architecture.

Many of the big questions that we face today, both in architecture and in society, are technological. Where is the unbridled advance of technological progress leading us? How much control do we even have over this development? Will we destroy ourselves? Can technology create a utopia?




"We are gods and might as well get good at it." - Stewart Brand, Whole Earth Catalog.

Economic argument in architecture.

Let us begin at the beginning. 

Superficially, Adolf Loos's argument in his famous essay "Ornament and Crime" is simply an aesthetic one - Loos argues that a modern, sophisticated man should perceive beauty in the natural character of objects (hence his immensely lush materials [picture]), not in unncessary ornamentation (lipstick on a pig.) 

Embedded in this argument is a very clear economic argument - we should not waste our time producing ornament, which has no function. 

Loos was writing at a very interesting time in the history of Germany - analogous perhaps to that of China or other developing nations today. Germany, which had unified [around Loos's birth], was emerging as an industrial and economic power, and had aspirations of competing with Great Britain and the United States on the world stage. It was, however, in some ways still backwards...

Fuller's approach to technology is quite different.










#### Ecology / Nature

The flip side of the technological problem is the question of nature, 




What then does sustainable architecture mean? To some people sustainable architecture means solar panels and compost bins - simple fixes that make our current buildings "greener" and thus more ethically acceptable. To others, it means smaller (tiny) houses, or dense urban living or bike transit - restructuring of our living situations to fix things. To others, it means overthrow of the current capitalist paradigm - a situation that is inextricably linked to our destructive use of the environment. To others it is about non-building - about adaptive reuse or changing perceptions so that the environmental damage that is implicit in building can be avoided.

This paper was inspired by Thomas Leeser's insistence that sustainability was not in fact an element of architecture - that it was simply a technological appendage that provided moral justification.


Taut prefigured much of modern ecological design with his 




Taut's weakness may perhaps be in the aesthetic focus of his work. While proposing "Alpine architecture" and Glass architecture that would re-order society, it was not clear how these things would be accomplished. [contrast with Fuller.]




Global / universal world view. Nation states are a clot in the world metabolism [find quote]

His works, in many ways, were all failures. The geodesic dome, his most famous and widely-built work, was highly influential on the works of people such as Frei Otto, ...

But more valuable than any of the individual objects that Fuller promoted, the most important thing that Fuller created was a world-view.

#### Practice

As an average student about to graduate from a middle-of-the-road M. Arch program, I have bene particularly concerned about the realities of practice. Unlike students at the GSD or GSAPP, I have not imagined that I will explode in some triumphal trajectory when I graduate from school. It seems far more likely that I will be an architectural serf, working long hours at a large corporation drawing bathroom details, or something like that. Having spent many hours over the last year pondering this possibility, I have come to the conclusion that the system of architectural practice is in some ways broken. 

Architecture has strangely isolated itself from many of the rewards of the field. Perhaps because of its attachment to historical models of practice based in the Beaux Arts, and the general conception of the architect as artist first, everything else second, architecture has defined itself as the production of drawings or representation of buildings. 

Buckminster Fuller offers a truly amazing and inspirational example of architectural practice. Although, like much of his liberal, patrician New England family Fuller matriculated to Harvard, he never graduated, twice being kicked out for [various infractions.] After kicking about various careers for several years, Fuller was in the throes of a depression, considering suicide, when he received a vision from, as he would refer to it, Universe - "[quote tk]. "

From this point on, Fuller committed himself "to work always and only for all of humanity" [Design Ecologies, 51] - although he would rely on (and run through) the money of his wife, various friends, etc., he became in essence a freelance inventor, proposing and developing schemes for different  universal products that would solve large-scale world problems. Is this kind of approach possible today? 

[Of course, one might also ask the question of whether Fuller was an architect at all. Fuller never formally studied architecture - indeed, Fuller never graduated from college at all - and his work was a synthesis of architecture, engineering, invention, and whimsy. ]

If anything, it is now far easier to be self-employed. The entire United States economy seems to be in the process of shifting from a system of large-scale corporations, pensions, etc. to one where each individual is his own product - marketing himself and taking what jobs appear. This kind of employment can take many forms - ultimately, Fuller was employed by various universities (speaking fees?)...

[If Bruno Taut was an architect whose life was embedded in his time, Fuller was the opposite - an autonomous architect whose works seem to stand as separate and outside of his era, essentially an architect of the future.]

Bruno Taut offers a somewhat frightening counterexample to Fuller - although an immensely talented architect, his career was heavily determined by the economic-historical aspects of his time - almost an inevitability considering that his mature practice happened to occur in Germany approximately between World War I and World War II. 

"Much of Taut's literary work in German remains untranslated into English."

Taut's first major works appear shortly before the beginning of the first World War - a time of immense productivity and optimism, Taut believed that Glass Architecture had the potential to transform society. Although this conviction was not broken by the outbreak of World War I and the subsequent depression, it meant that there were not many architectural commissions available for the decade after his early major works. Taut turned inwards in response, leading the creation of the "Crystal Chain" correspondence group - a kind of secret society dedicated to dreaming big ideas in private. [The Crystal Chain corresponds to the internet.] As the Weimar Republic emerged from the depression, they initiated a great public building campaign. Most of Taut's built work emerges from this period - large-scale, well-built, still-revered public housing projects such as the Horsehoe[...] and Uncle Tom's[...] 

The final phase of Taut's career was dictated by the rise of the Nazi party in Germany. Taut, a Jew, recognized the danger of the political climate, and left the country, first for the USSR and, finding no work there, moving on to Japan and later Turkey. In Japan, Taut made major contributions to the Western understanding of Japanese architecture, describing the Katsura Imperial Villa...

Adolf Loos provides another instructive example of how to practice architecture. Built a myth for himself by heading to America. Wrote as a critic before emerging as an architect in his own right. Worked as an interior designer before becoming an established, government-sponsored architect. 

The first, is that his essay "Ornament and Crime" has remained new and relevant to this very day, despite the fact that Loos predates modernism by quite a bit. The essay has such power that it is known and read by every architecture student at some point; it is seen as perhaps a precursor, or a starting point, for one of the main ideas of modernism - that decoration is sinful, or at least that decoration has no place for the modern architect.
