Throughout the semester I have presented the work of five architects - Adolf Loos, Bruno Taut, Bucky Fuller, (Cedric Price), (????) - and attempted to draw parallels between their lives and works to our modern experiences.



In some sense, the format seems strange and random - although I had some role in choosing these architects, they were also predetermined by the vagaries of the syllabus. They do not necessarily have any inherent connection to each other, there is not a clear progression of thought or practice between them. Although in some sense this approach seems random, it is also exciting to attempt to discover common threads between unrelated actors. I am in particular inspired by Colin Rowe's work on symmetry connecting Le Corbusier and Palladio.

#### Technology

Although Modernism may have overstated its break with the past, it is clear that the technological transformations of the Industrial Revolution have caused massive transformations in the practice of architecture. 

Technology has been the dominant theme of my time at Pratt, and is perhaps the dominant idea in current architectural theory. Postmodernism and critical theory have receded, and no large philosophical ideas have emerged to take their place, as architecture has spent the last ten (more?) years struggling to integrate the dramatic changes that the computer has and continues to apply to architecture.

Many of the big questions that we face today, both in architecture and in society, are technological. Where is the unbridled advance of technological progress leading us? How much control do we even have over this development? Will we destroy ourselves? Can technology create a utopia?




"We are gods and might as well get good at it." - Stewart Brand, Whole Earth Catalog.

Economic argument in architecture.

Let us begin at the beginning. 

Superficially, Adolf Loos's argument in his famous essay "Ornament and Crime" is simply an aesthetic one - Loos argues that a modern, sophisticated man should perceive beauty in the natural character of objects (hence his immensely lush materials [picture]), not in unncessary ornamentation (lipstick on a pig.) 

Embedded in this argument is a very clear economic argument - we should not waste our time producing ornament, which has no function. 

Loos was writing at a very interesting time in the history of Germany - analogous perhaps to that of China or other developing nations today. Germany, which had unified [around Loos's birth], was emerging as an industrial and economic power, and had aspirations of competing with Great Britain and the United States on the world stage. It was, however, in some ways still backwards...

Fuller's approach to technology is quite different.










#### Ecology / Nature

The flip side of the technological problem is the question of nature, 




What then does sustainable architecture mean? To some people sustainable architecture means solar panels and compost bins - simple fixes that make our current buildings "greener" and thus more ethically acceptable. To others, it means smaller (tiny) houses, or dense urban living or bike transit - restructuring of our living situations to fix things. To others, it means overthrow of the current capitalist paradigm - a situation that is inextricably linked to our destructive use of the environment. To others it is about non-building - about adaptive reuse or changing perceptions so that the environmental damage that is implicit in building can be avoided.

This paper was inspired by Thomas Leeser's insistence that sustainability was not in fact an element of architecture - that it was simply a technological appendage that provided moral justification.


Taut prefigured much of modern ecological design with his 




Taut's weakness may perhaps be in the aesthetic focus of his work. While proposing "Alpine architecture" and Glass architecture that would re-order society, it was not clear how these things would be accomplished. [contrast with Fuller.]




Global / universal world view. Nation states are a clot in the world metabolism [find quote]

His works, in many ways, were all failures. The geodesic dome, his most famous and widely-built work, was highly influential on the works of people such as Frei Otto, ...

But more valuable than any of the individual objects that Fuller promoted, the most important thing that Fuller created was a world-view.
