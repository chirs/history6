A Worldwide, 100 year long Crystal Chain: Bruno Taut, Bucky Fuller, Cedric Price (+ Adolf Loos)

"We are gods and might as well get good at it." - Stewart Brand, Whole Earth Catalog.

It's not really possible to write a true history of any period. Writing history is about reducing an endlessly complex, chaotic system into something that is comprehensible, digestible. It is a reduction of a messy reality into a didactic story, a story that the author wants to tell. Asked to write a history of the last hundred years of architecture (or really, a bit more than the last hundred years) - there are many questions that have to be answered - where to start, who to include and exclude, what is important and what isn't. What is the story that we want to tell. Ultimately, history is written for the present and the future. The purpose is to frame a set of events in a certain way, to create a narrative that will be useful for our present and future conditions.

This class in particular is founded on the idea of history as an operational device - we should use history as a way to examine ourselves, to inform our own architectural practice. For practicing architects, history cannot exist in isolation, as its own object, but must be marshalled for its use in our own designs. Just as we explore architectural precedents (physical history) to develop our own designs, we pick and choose the pieces of history that are useful to us, and are free to disregard the rest until the time comes that they will serve their purpose. 

Of course, this approach is vulnerable to critique. Colin Rowe assailed the modernists for their cynical use of theory and history to justify the forms that they wanted to make. Ultimately, the dream of modernism failed - revolutionary architecture did not produce revolutionary social systems - and we were left with a big mess to clean up and make sense of. Of course we still struggle with this problem today. At the same time, modern architecture also produced a beautiful and powerful set of forms and building, which could not have been produced without the aggressively confident theories that supported their creation. And Colin Rowe makes peace with this problem - while the theory that supported modernism fell apart, the forms remain valuable, fascinating, beautiful - and we can make up new reasons for their existence if we so choose.

This class addressed architectural history from a perspective close to the much-discredited "Great Man theory" of history - that history is the story of great men, "heroes", whose actions largely determine the path along which humanity advances. Presentations were assigned around powerful figures - architects or groups of architects who had a powerful impact on the profession. Occasionally, we dealt with an architect who was disregarded in his own time - the Van Goghs of architecture, such as Frederick Kiesler, newly rediscovered by the parametricists - but even these men (and they were almost all men) will be great for some amount of time.

Other elements - political or social or economic factors, even the large class of "mediocre" architects whose names are not worth mentioning - occasionally formed a backdrop, but we viewed history through the lens of these important people who - this being architectural school - we all dream we will join one day in the pantheon. Of course, probably none of us will, but we will address that fact after we graduate, not in the school where we are all trained to become great designers.

Although this model is problematic - and what isn't problematic in architecture, anyway - I will do what I can to follow a few strains and learn from the great men who I presented about. I will attempt to describe their individual, highly idiosyncratic life stories as a unified thesis about the progression of architecture from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 21st. Although the idea of this becoming a real story of architecture is inherently broken, we all know that architecture is a field where good lies are more valuable than awkward truths. So let us spin some good stories about what the future of architecture means for the past, and vice versa.

I will be telling the story of four men - Adolf Loos, Bruno Taut, Bucky Fuller, Cedric Price - and maybe a few other characters will make appearances.

Adolf Loos was born in Brno, Austria-Hungary, in 1870, and died in Vienna, Austria in 1933. Bruno Taut was born Bruno Taut was born in Konigsberg, Germany 9 years after Unification in 1880, and died in Istanbul, Turkey in 1938, having fled Nazi Germany because he was a radical Jew who certainly would have been murdered. Bucky Fuller was born to an aristocratic family in Milton, MA in 1895, and died in Los Angeles, CA in 1983. Cedric Price was born in Stone, Staffordshire in 1934, and died in London in 2003. 

In choosing my presentations for this semester, I have been drawn to radical architects - architects who for various reasons stand outside of the traditional architectural narrative. Of course, any important architect in some ways radical - she must propose new and novel ideas, ideas that challenge the orthodoxy of the field in order to 

In this paper, I will attempt to apply these lessons of these men to three subjects of particular interest to me - technology, nature, and architectural practice itself.


#### Technology

[Superficially, Adolf Loos's argument in his famous essay "Ornament and Crime" is simply an aesthetic one - Loos argues that a modern, sophisticated man should perceive beauty in the natural character of objects (hence his immensely lush materials [picture]), not in unncessary ornamentation (lipstick on a pig.) 

Embedded in this argument is a very clear economic argument - we should not waste our time producing ornament, which has no function. 

Loos was writing at a very interesting time in the history of Germany - analogous perhaps to that of China or other developing nations today. Germany, which had unified [around Loos's birth], was emerging as an industrial and economic power, and had aspirations of competing with Great Britain and the United States on the world stage. It was, however, in some ways still backwards...

Fuller's approach to technology is quite different.]


Although Modernism may have overstated its break with the past, it is clear that the technological transformations of the Industrial Revolution have caused massive transformations in the practice of architecture. 

Technology has been the dominant theme of my time at Pratt, and is perhaps the dominant idea in current architectural theory. Postmodernism and critical theory have receded, and no large philosophical ideas have emerged to take their place, as architecture has spent the last ten (more?) years struggling to integrate the dramatic changes that the computer has and continues to apply to architecture.

Many of the big questions that we face today, both in architecture and in society, are technological. Where is the unbridled advance of technological progress leading us? How much control do we even have over this development? Will we destroy ourselves? Can technology create a utopia?





#### Nature

What then does sustainable architecture mean? To some people sustainable architecture means solar panels and compost bins - simple fixes that make our current buildings "greener" and thus more ethically acceptable. To others, it means smaller (tiny) houses, or dense urban living or bike transit - restructuring of our living situations to fix things. To others, it means overthrow of the current capitalist paradigm - a situation that is inextricably linked to our destructive use of the environment. To others it is about non-building - about adaptive reuse or changing perceptions so that the environmental damage that is implicit in building can be avoided.


The watchword of today is sustainability. We are faced with very real problems about the continuation of human life on this planet - global warming is producing dangerous changes to the environment, we are consuming finite resources at an astounding rate. What is architecture's role in this global crisis? Some architects believe that this is the most pressing issue facing architecture - its relationship to deep social problems

#### Practice

As an average student about to graduate from a middle-of-the-road M. Arch program, I have bene particularly concerned about the realities of practice. Unlike students at the GSD or GSAPP, I have not imagined that I will explode in some triumphal trajectory when I graduate from school. It seems far more likely that I will be an architectural serf, working long hours at a large corporation drawing bathroom details, or something like that. Having spent many hours over the last year pondering this possibility, I have come to the conclusion that the system of architectural practice is in some ways broken. 

Architecture has strangely isolated itself from many of the rewards of the field. Perhaps because of its attachment to historical models of practice based in the Beaux Arts, and the general conception of the architect as artist first, everything else second, architecture has defined itself as the production of drawings or representation of buildings. 

Buckminster Fuller offers a truly amazing and inspirational example of architectural practice. Although, like much of his liberal, patrician New England family Fuller matriculated to Harvard, he never graduated, twice being kicked out for [various infractions.] After kicking about various careers for several years, Fuller was in the throes of a depression, considering suicide, when he received a vision from, as he would refer to it, Universe - "[quote tk]. "

From this point on, Fuller committed himself "to work always and only for all of humanity" [Design Ecologies, 51] - although he would rely on (and run through) the money of his wife, various friends, etc., he became in essence a freelance inventor, proposing and developing schemes for different  universal products that would solve large-scale world problems. Is this kind of approach possible today? 

[Of course, one might also ask the question of whether Fuller was an architect at all. Fuller never formally studied architecture - indeed, Fuller never graduated from college at all - and his work was a synthesis of architecture, engineering, invention, and whimsy. ]

If anything, it is now far easier to be self-employed. The entire United States economy seems to be in the process of shifting from a system of large-scale corporations, pensions, etc. to one where each individual is his own product - marketing himself and taking what jobs appear. This kind of employment can take many forms - ultimately, Fuller was employed by various universities (speaking fees?)...

[If Bruno Taut was an architect whose life was embedded in his time, Fuller was the opposite - an autonomous architect whose works seem to stand as separate and outside of his era, essentially an architect of the future.]

Bruno Taut offers a somewhat frightening counterexample to Fuller - although an immensely talented architect, his career was heavily determined by the economic-historical aspects of his time - almost an inevitability considering that his mature practice happened to occur in Germany approximately between World War I and World War II. 

"Much of Taut's literary work in German remains untranslated into English."

Taut's first major works appear shortly before the beginning of the first World War - a time of immense productivity and optimism, Taut believed that Glass Architecture had the potential to transform society. Although this conviction was not broken by the outbreak of World War I and the subsequent depression, it meant that there were not many architectural commissions available for the decade after his early major works. Taut turned inwards in response, leading the creation of the "Crystal Chain" correspondence group - a kind of secret society dedicated to dreaming big ideas in private. [The Crystal Chain corresponds to the internet.] As the Weimar Republic emerged from the depression, they initiated a great public building campaign. Most of Taut's built work emerges from this period - large-scale, well-built, still-revered public housing projects such as the Horsehoe[...] and Uncle Tom's[...] 

The final phase of Taut's career was dictated by the rise of the Nazi party in Germany. Taut, a Jew, recognized the danger of the political climate, and left the country, first for the USSR and, finding no work there, moving on to Japan and later Turkey. In Japan, Taut made major contributions to the Western understanding of Japanese architecture, describing the Katsura Imperial Villa...

Adolf Loos provides another instructive example of how to practice architecture. Built a myth for himself by heading to America. Wrote as a critic before emerging as an architect in his own right. Worked as an interior designer before becoming an established, government-sponsored architect. 

The first, is that his essay "Ornament and Crime" has remained new and relevant to this very day, despite the fact that Loos predates modernism by quite a bit. The essay has such power that it is known and read by every architecture student at some point; it is seen as perhaps a precursor, or a starting point, for one of the main ideas of modernism - that decoration is sinful, or at least that decoration has no place for the modern architect.



### Rebellion

Architecture is a field that is simultaneously conservative and revolutionary. We all believe that architecture is ahead of most of the rest of society - it asks the important questions, and isn't afraid to answer them. While other fields act in service of capital, or technology, or politicians, architecture holds itself apart, endlessly demanding verification, always challenging assumptions, attempting to do - represent - something that it doesn't know exactly what it is. Although there are endless ideas about the point of architecture, there's not really an answer to the question - in some ways perhaps architecture's role is the continual challenging of assumptions - about physical space, but also about personal experience, political and economic relationships, all of the factors of civilization the coalesce into the construction of a building.

At the same time, architecture must admit a range of fundamental conservatisms. The most obvious, and the most readily discussed, is that any building is very expensive, and architects tend to work on the most expensive buildings. This immediately distinguishes the field from art and design - while it is possible to produce art at relatively little cost, it is only an enormously wealthy individual who can personally fund the construction of her building designs - and it the very rare architect who can even afford to practice "paper architecture" for very long. This puts architecture in the double bind described by Tafuri - when architecture operates in society, it naturally reinforces the structural logics of the system that it inhabits (in our present experience, global capitalism.) If architecture attempts to resist these structures - "when it attempts to reassert its own disruptive voice, capitalism simply withdraws it from service." The more expensive the building, the more impossible the idea of resistance becomes - but truly revolutionary architecture, usually unbuilt, ends up having no impact on the world, only joining the long list of revolutionary projects that architects - and nobody else - love to discuss.

A quick look at the architects under discussion reveals the truth of this proposition. Bruno Taut dreamed of a revolutionary architecture, a crystal architecture that would transform society. What resulted from many years of this kind of dreaming, from the secret group that he constructed to discuss these ideas? No buildings, save for the Glass Pavilion that was destroyed shortly after being constructed, for which we do not even have drawings. What Taut actually built were instead a series of excellent, progressive, but fundamentally normative socialist housing projects. These are in no way revolutionary, and the more successful they are, the more they reinforce the government's argument that it can take care of its citizens, and there is no need for fundamental revolution. 

Buckminster Fuller's experience is quite different, but rhymes with that of Taut. Fuller came from a well-to-do family, and used his excellent social connections to fund his early projects. This starts out as rather questionable - is it really possible for the upper class to subsidize a world-transformational architecture? The interests are fundamentally mis-aligned, as any radical destabilization of global power structures will make the wealthy significantly worse off. (Later in his career, Fuller's worldwide fame allowed him many other avenues with which to pursue his revolutionary projects; these may perhaps be criticized from other angles, but let's move on.) Fuller however ultimately failed to produce any of the dramatic transformations that he promised. His Dymaxion car, which promised to radically transform personal transport, resulted in only three prototypes, were almost impossible to steer, and never came close to accomplishing the goal. The Dymaxion house, likewise promising to revolutionize housing with a cheap, light, mass-produced dwelling that would eliminate world housing shortages, again resulted in a few prototypes and nothing more. The fact that both of these products failed to ever reach mass production, on any sort of scale, indicate that the fault was perhaps Fuller's - perhaps he was not able to manage the large-scale operations required to produce these products, or perhaps his revolutionary desires meant that his dreams continually outpaced his reach - his projects had a tendency towards feature creep, where more, better ideas would continually be implemented before the earlier problems had been completely solved. Even Fuller's most famous project, his Geodesic Dome, on which he spent the last four decades of his life, when he was an international celebrity - was more successful as a precedent for other light-weight, space frame designs than a success in itself. The Geodesic Dome is a highly problematic structure, with its spherical design resulting in wasted space and uncomfortable living conditions; in this case, it seems like the purity of the design dominated the possiblity of creating a generic living space, although perhaps the idea was broken from the beginning.

Cedric Price offers a third perspective on the idea of revolution, one that is simultaneously inspirational and depressing. Price (like much of Archigram) believed in the idea of an expansive architecture - architecture was not just about buildings, but about transforming social conditions through whatever means are available, in particular through the consumer technological revolution that was exploding in the 1960's West. As a result of this perspective, Price became famous for his reluctance to build - while most architects are eager to build things, to establish their legacy, Price recognized the enormous expense and permanence of architectural solutions, and often advocated against building anything if he believed that the best option. Many of the buildings that Price ended up building were thus temporary structures, quite a few of which have since been destroyed. (What Price did not acknowledge about temporary building is that buildings develop inertia, and so much that is designed as temporary simply becomes mediocre permanent building.) Price's most famous, and most revolutionary structures were, however, not built at all. The Fun Palace, designed as a transformational, educational, entertainment complex for the citizens of London, spent years trying to negotiate funding through the English government; ultimately, it was not taken seriously, or perceived as too subversive, or simply not understood or trusted. A similarly ambitious educational / residential project, the Potteries Thinkbelt in northern England, also never received funding for much the same reasons. While Taut was willing to compromise his ideals to build something "good enough", Price was not willing to build unless it was the right structure, and thus hardly built anything at all.

[say something to summarize]

This has all been discussing the way that architecture can function as a revolutionary actor within a conservative society. A question much less frequently asked is architecture's fundamental conservatism [it is possible for a revolutionary to be conservative and doctrinaire also, right?] Architecture, so quick to challenge the assumptions of society and ask what it is supposed to represent, is far more reluctant to question itself. It may be willing to have arguments about what exactly is the right way to practice architecture, but there are other questions that it does not permit to be asked.

Colin Rowe, in his preface to 5 architects, described Modernism as "an elaborately indirect mechanism for suppression of feelings of guilt" - the early modernist movement consisted of a set of somewhat incoherent, mutually incompatible calls for revolution, presenting architecture as a means of radical social change. This project of course did not succeed - while it resulted in the production of a fascinating and novel set of habitable forms, it did not result in the fundamental transformation of society. Late modernism continued to parrot these claims, but by this point it had become obvious that architecture was not performing as it promised - instead, the theory existed to justify and bolster the production of these interesting forms. 

Dell Upton advanced an even more powerful critique of architectural history - he proposed that architectural history existed not as a mechanism to explore the role that architecture has to play in the world, but as a system to legitimize the theories of architecture, and thereby the architectural profession itself. Rather than fundamentally criticizing the role of architecture, it instead glorified it, allowing for architects to separate themselves as above and separate from the world at large. 

While Upton was simply advocating for a new kind of architectural history, with a more inclusive, less separationist perspective, a similar criticism can be applied to architectural practice itself. Architecture emerged from a set of social and political circumstances, and has entrenched itself quite firmly as a specific, separate way of viewing the world. We perceive the world through an architectural lens. But how do we know that we are in fact observing through the correct lens - how do we know that our apparatus is the right one? There are many reasons to doubt architecture. Pedagogy is curiously disengaged from practice - what we learn in school is not necessarily what we will use in practice. Of course, this practice is potentially beneficial - it allows us to ask questions about whether what we are doing is right, and to think about the big picture when doing designs that fundamentally require compromises. However, if we compare architects to doctors or lawyers or engineers, we must ask why it is that architects seem poor, impotent, and unhappy compared to these other groups. As architecture students, we idolize and fantasize about joining the pantheon of architectural greats - but are afraid to discuss, much less engage with, the fact that very few of us will join this group. The vast majority of us will join the disempowered masses in the service of these greats, or compromise our ideals and work in service of the entrenched power structures of society. 

The world demands dramatically more design - much of what we produce is designed badly or not at all - but we do not take as our obligation to produce these. We spend our time instead learning from the great masters, and accepting that this is the way that architecture has to be. But of course that is not the case - had architecture emerged at another time, in another context, it would be different - the field unconsciously, secretly preserves its own authority and the authority of the powerful few at the top of the mountain - while giving little thought to everyone else who practices, or to outside of the club. When true radicals emerge - Kiesler, for example - they are disregarded as not relevant to the contemporary discourse. Or, when Christopher Alexander proposes a radically different approach to architectural practice, he is ostracized as a threat to the fundamental ideas that every architect has committed their lives, and their professional careers to.

To truly destablize architecture from within seems almost impossible - discussions of the radical technologization of the field are frequently met with proposals for government intervention to protect architects. The AIA forbids anybody who is not licensed to call themselves an architect, under the threat of prosecution. The justification for this is that it preserves the standards of the field, a particularly important point when building failure can result in the loss of life. But it certainly seems like this is more about protecting the club of architects than it is about protecting the rest of society.
