# The future.

So it's hard to tell a comprehensive history about the history of architecture, or anything really.

I'm going to talk about one topic, which is the relationship of the future.


# Taut

"The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed." - William Gibson

Taut saw society as bifurcated into two groups, those living in the present and those living in the future. Peasants were living in 16th century, modern Viennese living in the present, Americans maybe living in the future.

Idea of the future involved the efficient expression of modern conditions. Simple materials, etc.

For some reason, slide #2 still seems like the future. Maybe a retro future.


# Futurists

Sant'Elia, speed, technology, power, deadly.

Harvey Corbett

These guys mostly died in WWI which seems like an appropriate end to this movement. The future killed them.



# Bruno Taut

Glass Pavilion

Strange new worlds that could be created through technology.


# Constructivists / Monument to the Third International

New era, utopian.


# Dymaxion, Archigram

Capitalist Techno-utopianism.

Personal technology as solution.

"Cool"

# Fuller / World game


# Parametric

Give up on utopian dreams?

The future as the production of weirdness.



# Regressive

This is who we studied this semester.

All these revolutionaries are white men. 

So this is a very specific future that we are imagining.

"The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed." - William Gibson

These are the people who imagine a future from their own perspectives.

"Great man theory."


# Questions

Has architecture been successful at this project?

What are the vulnerabilities / biases of the field?

Should architecture envision a future?
