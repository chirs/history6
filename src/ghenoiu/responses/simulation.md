### simulation, fiction, virtuality
#### Eisenman / End of the Classical

"The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors/functions of the selected physical or abstract system or process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time."

"Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time." [wiki?] Once upon a time, architects had to do their simulations entirely by imagination. Nowadays, we have computers that can simulate for us. We can simulate sunlight, solar heat gain, weather patterns, traffic flows. We can use simulations to collect and organize data, to determine or support our design decisions. Simulation, to a degree, can teach us how the real world will perform. This seems good.

Rendering used to be done entirely by hand, but this had an element of simple simulation. Two point perspective is a simulation of real-world vision. Our computer simulations are much more powerful, however. They are extraordinarly powerful tools of persuasion, ways that we can show a building just as it will look once it has been built (often, better than it will look when it is built.) This over-precision makes us uncomfortable with the simulations. They are too good, too persuasive. They project too much reality. They are morally questionable. First, we learn to make our simulated renders accurate; then, we have to learn how to make them less accurate. They must lie to tell the truth. [Sometimes we feel that the simulations are "too real" - that they make some artistic choices more difficult while over-specificizing what is an ambiguous future reality.]

Eisenman, writing before computers dominated architecture, sees simulations differently. He regards them as half-lies rather than almost-truths.

Eisenman claims that architecture has historically operated under a series of fictions, and that the break that modernism claimed to represent - and represented in other art forms - failed to deal with these fundamental problems. These fictions are: representation, reason, and history. Whereas architecture may have at one point been able to transmit meaning through orders, representation no longer carries meaning because we no longer believe in the classical orders the way we used to.

The second is the idea of reason - whereas architecture originally derived its authority from its relationship with the divine, and later substituted science into the place of the divine, a more thorough inspection of the apparatus that produces "knowledge" 

"The processes for knowing - measurement, logical proof, causality-turned out to be a network of value-laden arguments, no more than effective modes of persuasion."

"alternative fictions for the origin can be proposed: for example, one that is arbitrary, one that has no external value derived from meaning, truth, or timelessness."

What an exciting idea! What if we could simulate whole worlds? Well, that seems impossible, and morally dubious. At the least, what if we could simulate different architectures? What would architecture be without steel, or concrete, or the column, or the arch? What would architecture be without Vitruvius, or Le Corbusier, or Robert Venturi? 

If we can imagine an infinity of alterate architectures, what do we do with them? What architectural simulations would be the most valuable? 



Eisenman deals very delicately with the idea of fiction in his piece "The End of the Classical," wherein he busts apart modernism, claiming that it was never even really present in the first place.

"Thus to proceed from "error" or fiction is to counter consciously the tradition of "mis-reading" on which the classical unwittingly depended-not a presumedly logical transformation of something a priori, but a deliberate "error" stated as such, one which presupposes only its own intemal truth."

"What can be the model for architecture when the essence of what was effective in the classical model-the presumed rational value of structures, representations, methodologies of origins and ends. and deductive processes-has been shown to be a simulation?"
