"The theoretical presumptions of modern architecture, located as they once were in a matrix of eschatological and utopian fantasy, began to mean very little when the technological and social revolution whose imminence the modern movement had assumed failed to take place."

Rowe begins his essay, much like Upton's Landscape History piece, with an attack on the current state of architecture. Unlike Upton, who attacks the foundation of architectural history, Rowe attacks the products of modernist architecture. If the utopian modernist vision is not to be reached, then what should we do with the body of architectural forms that were produced by modernism? Do we discard them - since they no longer have meaning without modernist theory to support them?

Rowe asserts that modernist theory was never itself coherent or meaningful - rather, it was "an incoherent bundle of highly volatile sentiments", and, more significantly, "was an elaborately indirect mechanism for suppression of feelings of guilt." The true goal of modernist functionalism was to erase the artist's hand from the producction of architecture, to present an external justification for "his decisions are not so much his own as they are, somehow, immanent in scientific, or historical, or social process."

He then closes with a series of questions - can architecture be completely logical? must buildings have social goals (and how often)? what is the role of the architect in history? how to respond to the zeitgeist? how to use precedent? can radical architecture be popular and intelligible?

Rowe uses these questions - and Eisenman expands on the idea subsequently - to argue that formal study in architecture is not only permissible, but may be more meaningful than other kinds of architectural research. While architecture dreams of solving social or existential problems that are well beyond its reach, it is certainly possible to create - or at least imagine - buildings, spaces, forms - the stuff of pure architecture.





In his piece "Architectural History or Landscape History?", Dell Upton proposes a response to some fundamental criticisms of architectural history. 

The criticism asserts that architectural history is fundamentally biased and ill-defined. The history of architectural history is deeply entwined with the development and justification of architectural theory and design - it is a product of "architectural designers concerned with locating their works within the broad stream of tradition" with the social goal of "legitimizing architects as professionals"

Traditional architectural history assumes some of the biases of the 19th century period when it developed - "the discipline of architecture was to be socially defined and socially exercised." Upton identifies three models of understanding, the central concepts of "aesthetic universals, the individual work...as the unit of analysis, and the distinction between creator and audience" as the fundamental biases of architectural history.

Even attempts to escape this paradigm are inevitably structured by it. For example, the "study of vernacular architecture is deeply and inextricably entwined with that of high architecture." "Rather than denying or even supplementing the high culture, therefore, histories of the vernacular complete it."

Upton concludes his essay with a response to the fundamental biases of architectural history. He proposes the cultural landscape, rather than the individual artist or building, as the basic unit of inquiry. He proposes a new approach to history where "its focus is the human experience of its own landscape, rather than the relationship of maker and object." While this architecture history would integrate the current discipline, it would be  "concerned with construction only on the way to construin

Ultimately, Upton's goal seems to be to integrate architectural history into broader forms of knowledge, "relationship among human experience and the generation of meaning" 
"The boundaries among the humanities are dissolving" ...
