Rossi / City


The city as an object.

Individuality of a building

"a complicated entity which has developed in both space and time"

"the city is constituted as a totality and that this totality is its raison d'etre" -> French geographers

"there is something in the nature of urban artifacts that renders them very similar - and not only metaphorically - to a work of art." 
"although they are conditioned, they also condition."

"there will always be a type of experience recognizable only to those who have walked through the particular building, street, or district"

"every region is distinguished from the wilderness in this respect: that it is an immense repository of labor....This land is thus not a work of nature; it is the work of our hands, our artificial homeland." -> 1491?

"to the extent that they are our 'artificial homeland' and objects have been constructed, they also testify to values; they constitute memory and permanence."

"Sometimes I ask myself why architecture is not analyzed...in terms of its profound value as a human thing that shapes reality and adapts material according to an aesthetic conception."

"I would define the concept of type as something that is permanent and complex, a logical principle that is prior to form and that constitutes it."
