Rowe / 5 architects

"The theoretical presumptions of modern architecture, located as they once were in a matrix of eschatological and utopian fantasy, began to mean very little when the technological and social revolution whose imminence the modern movement had assumed failed to take place."

Rowe begins his essay, much like Upton's Landscape History piece, with an attack on the current state of architecture. Unlike Upton, who attacks the foundation of architectural history, Rowe attacks the products of modernist architecture. If the utopian modernist vision is not to be reached, then what should we do with the body of architectural forms that were produced by modernism? Do we discard them - since they no longer have meaning without modernist theory to support them?

Rowe asserts that modernist theory was never itself coherent or meaningful - rather, it was "an incoherent bundle of highly volatile sentiments", and, more significantly, "was an elaborately indirect mechanism for suppression of feelings of guilt." The true goal of modernist functionalism was to erase the artist's hand from the producction of architecture, to present an external justification for "his decisions are not so much his own as they are, somehow, immanent in scientific, or historical, or social process."

He then closes with a series of questions - can architecture be completely logical? must buildings have social goals (and how often)? what is the role of the architect in history? how to respond to the zeitgeist? how to use precedent? can radical architecture be popular and intelligible?

Rowe uses these questions - and Eisenman expands on the idea subsequently - to argue that formal study in architecture is not only permissible, but may be more meaningful than other kinds of architectural research. While architecture dreams of solving social or existential problems that are well beyond its reach, it is certainly possible to create - or at least imagine - buildings, spaces, forms - the stuff of pure architecture.
