"study of vernacular architecture is deeply and inextricably entwined with that of high architecture."  [Upton]

"Rather than denying or even supplementing the high culture, therefore, histories of the vernacular complete it." - Upton


Interest in "anonymous architecture" continues to this day. The internet has produced a situation where the boundary between "high architecture" and "anonymous architecture" is blurring. Anybody can add whatever images they want to their pinterest board, intermingling Arts and Crafts classics with contemporary knock-offs. Suburban subdivisions are designed by architects, but these architects prefer not to let their names be known. 

What do we mean when we talk about "anonymous architecture"? This question is very problematic, in that different definitions frame the question in different ways, and produce very different results.

The most famous example of anonymous architecture research comes from Bernard Rudofsky's "Architecture Without Architects." Rudofsky defines his "anonymous architecture" generally as architecture produced by cultures that do not have the formalized position of "architect" - no productions of modern western civilizations could be integrated into his book. Rudofsky looks at "architecture without architects" to discover beautiful new forms, "primitive" architectural patterns that is somehow more "alive" and exciting than austere modernism. 

Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, a decade before Rudofsky, defined "anonymous architecture" in a different way - 


interrogates "anonymous architecture" to discover new architectural truths - their methods and results, however, are quite different. Moholy-Nagy, on the other hand, uses anonymous architecture to inform a deeper practice of modern architecture. 

Moholy-Nagy is making the argument for the synthesis of locus and autonomy.

Essentially, her argument is about context. The book is divided into three sections, each related to a different contextual feature: "expression of site and climate, ... form and function, ... materials and skills." answering the "where, why and how of anonymous architecture."

Moholy-Nagy's essay is an attack on the over-homogenization that was a consequence modern architecture. She anticipates counter-arguments, saying that this kind of research will not be useful "to those who define architecture either as pure esthetics [Le Corbusier]...or those who consider it predominantly a branch of modern technology." Although she refers to Corbusier, she expends most of her ammunition on the engineering branch of architecture - exemplified by Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House, and tract housing in general ("boxes, held together by no more than Federal Loan Certificates."

 Moholy-Nagy proposes an origin story for architecture - as the "selection of means and meanings in deliberately planned environments" and shortly after describes the original causes - "diversity of form and function; economy of resources and upkeep; duration as material value and spiritual symbol."  [p19]



Are there other ways of defining "anonymous architecture?" [What ways do these authors define it?]
Is this category even valid anymore? [Ruy stuff?]




Ultimately, while Rudofsky may be making claims for an "inclusive architecture" - Moholy-Nagy is working precisely within the traditional doctrine of modernism. She looks for "genius" in anonymous architecture - "Each example shown in this book is characteristic but it is not necessarily the best in existence." - and she hopes that this genius allows us to find genius in our standard modern architecture.
