"study of vernacular architecture is deeply and inextricably entwined with that of high architecture."  [Upton]

"Rather than denying or even supplementing the high culture, therefore, histories of the vernacular complete it." - Upton


Interest in "anonymous architecture" continues to this day. The internet has produced a situation where the boundary between "high architecture" and "anonymous architecture" is blurring. Anybody can add whatever images they want to their pinterest board, intermingling Arts and Crafts classics with contemporary knock-offs. Suburban subdivisions are designed by architects, but these architects prefer not to let their names be known. 

What do we mean when we talk about "anonymous architecture"? This question is very problematic, in that different definitions frame the question in different ways, and produce very different results.

The most famous example of anonymous architecture research comes from Bernard Rudofsky's "Architecture Without Architects." Rudofsky defines his "anonymous architecture" generally as architecture produced by cultures that do not have the formalized position of "architect" - no productions of modern western civilizations could be integrated into his book. Rudofsky looks at "architecture without architects" to discover beautiful new forms, "primitive" architectural patterns that is somehow more "alive" and exciting than austere modernism. 

Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, a decade before Rudofsky, defined "anonymous architecture" in a different way - 


interrogates "anonymous architecture" to discover new architectural truths - their methods and results, however, are quite different. Moholy-Nagy, on the other hand, uses anonymous architecture to inform a deeper practice of modern architecture. 

Moholy-Nagy is making the argument for the synthesis of locus and autonomy.

Essentially, her argument is about context. The book is divided into three sections, each related to a different contextual feature: "expression of site and climate, ... form and function, ... materials and skills." answering the "where, why and how of anonymous architecture."

Moholy-Nagy's essay is an attack on the over-homogenization that was a consequence modern architecture. She anticipates counter-arguments, saying that this kind of research will not be useful "to those who define architecture either as pure esthetics [Le Corbusier]...or those who consider it predominantly a branch of modern technology." Although she refers to Corbusier, she expends most of her ammunition on the engineering branch of architecture - exemplified by Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House, and tract housing in general ("boxes, held together by no more than Federal Loan Certificates."

 Moholy-Nagy proposes an origin story for architecture - as the "selection of means and meanings in deliberately planned environments" and shortly after describes the original causes - "diversity of form and function; economy of resources and upkeep; duration as material value and spiritual symbol."  [p19]



Are there other ways of defining "anonymous architecture?" [What ways do these authors define it?]
Is this category even valid anymore? [Ruy stuff?]




Ultimately, while Rudofsky may be making claims for an "inclusive architecture" - Moholy-Nagy is working precisely within the traditional doctrine of modernism. She looks for "genius" in anonymous architecture - "Each example shown in this book is characteristic but it is not necessarily the best in existence." - and she hopes that this genius allows us to find genius in our standard modern architecture.





simulation, fiction, virtuality
Eisenman / End of the Classical

"Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time."

The integration of the computer and architecture has brought digital simulation close to the fingertips of every architecture student. Our rendering process revolves around simulations - some more precise, some less - of a physical world operating along certain laws. Likewise, we are capable of simulating environmental factors - daylighting, solar heat gain, etc.; transit simulations dictate when and where roads are built.

We approach these simulations by judging their accuracy - are they "close enough" to the reality that we are trying to represent? Sometimes we feel that the simulations are "too real" - that they make some artistic choices more difficult while over-specificizing what is an ambiguous future reality.

Eisenman approaches the idea of a simulation from the opposite side - from a philosophical rather than computational perspective, and looking at simulations as half-lies rather than almost-truths.

Eisenman claims that architecture has historically operated under a series of fictions, and that the break that modernism claimed to represent - and represented in other art forms - failed to deal with these fundamental problems. These fictions are: representation, reason, and history. Whereas architecture may have at one point been able to transmit meaning through orders, representation no longer carries meaning because we no longer believe in the classical orders the way we used to.

The second is the idea of reason - whereas architecture originally derived its authority from its relationship with the divine, and later substituted science into the place of the divine, a more thorough inspection of the apparatus that produces "knowledge" 

"The processes for knowing - measurement, logical proof, causality-turned out to be a network of value-laden arguments, no more than effective modes of persuasion."

* Alternative fictions

"alternative fictions for the origin can be proposed: for example, one that is arbitrary, one that has no external value derived from meaning, truth, or timelessness."

What if the Nazis won World War II? What if the meteor didn't hit Earth 65 million years ago? What if Vitruvius's De Architecture was lost to history? What if modern architecture had developed out of Islamic or Indian architecural theory rather than Western? What if architecture was founded on ugliness?

What is the use of the simulation? What is its relationship to truth and falsehood?



Eisenman deals very delicately with the idea of fiction in his piece "The End of the Classical," wherein he busts apart modernism, claiming that it was never even really present in the first place.

* 



"Thus to proceed from "error" or fiction is to counter consciously the tradition of "mis-reading" on which the classical unwittingly depended-not a presumedly logical transformation of something a priori, but a deliberate "error" stated as such, one which presupposes only its own intemal truth."

"What can be the model for architecture when the essence of what was effective in the classical model-the presumed rational value of structures, representations, methodologies of origins and ends. and deductive processes-has been shown to be a simulation?"



"The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors/functions of the selected physical or abstract system or process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time."




### Remembering, Forgetting, Imagining

#### Tafuri / L'architecture dans le Boudoir + Ross / Architecture of the City


"At the origins of the critical act are always found the acts of distinguishing, separating, and disintegrating a given structure. Without the act of disintegrating the object under analysis, it is impossible to rewrite it." 

Memory is a process of construction. We do not store a complete memory in our brains, but instead small pieces. When we retrieve a memory, we fill in the blanks between the pieces of memory. Over time the memory gets molded, in a somewhat random process, into a new object. A memory is always an interpretation, a synthesis of fragments of original moment and what has been experienced since. 

The method of loci is a classic mnemonic technique in which individual memories are connected to individual rooms in an imaginary building; massive memory chains can be constructed in this manner. 

Memories exist in a kind of interface with the natural world. Memories lie dormant, waiting to be triggered, an thus remade; in the same way, memory resides in every architectural object, waiting to be read, interpreted.

What then is the nature of the memory that is embedded in architectural space? It is a [pastiche?] Monuments project a kind of grand collective memory - they reflect values from a certain time, as perceived through modern eyes. They are in some ways the most honest and telling of the memory shards of the city, and in some ways the biggest liars.

What about the microscopic fragments? The potsherds, arrowheads, and refuse piles of architectural history? This can, in aggregate, tell us something - analysis can tell us what was eaten, what kind of kiln was used, contextualize entire bodies of information. On their own, however, they reveal little, allowing extrapolations that can be wildly incorrect.

This presents itself most clearly in the concept of the ruin - an object that is at once monumental and invisible. Sometimes, ruins retain fragments of memory - but, more interestingly, sometimes ruins become completely forgotten and reinvented. [Humayun's Tomb?]

For me, this idea conjures the idea of ruins - a ruin is the evidence of a forgotten civilization - and while we may believe that we can "read" and thus interpret the meaning of this object, we are almost certainly wrong. Our reading is contingent on our present circumstances, our goals and desires. 

And in fact all architectural objects share this quality to some extent with ruins. The Seagram Building holds a dramatically different meaning today than it did when it was constructed - the original meaning of the building is entirely inaccessible to modern eyes. We can perhaps catch glimpses of it, but the original meaning is lost, and our best hope is to reconstruct a story that is useful to ourselves (or myself, since my story will not have any relevance to you.)


There are fragments of his text that seem immensely valuable, but the thing itself is beyond my comprehension. What is the locus? We discussed it in class, but I've forgotten the answer.





Urban design = law + architecture.


"Architecture can respond to the dynamism of social patterns by closely accommodating well-observed particulars, by creating spaces of usefully loose fit, or by propo sing arr angements that attempt to conduce or facilitate specific behaviors outside the conventions of the present and familiar." - Sorkin








Krier / Eisenman.

"The positions are so symmetrical that there is no dissonance or exchange. Each side, in fact, adjusts to become the opposite of the other."

Watching the Sanders / Hillary debate last night, I was reminded of Mark Wigley's critique of Eisenman and Krier as "simply two matching brands."

The "Overton window" describes a social pyschological construct of "the range of ideas the public will accept." We in the early 21st century United States occupy a certain sector of this window - the architecture students at Pratt, certainly, a different one than their parents, etc.

The persistent power of Trump this semester makes me wonder about the function of rhetoric.

Define new ideas? Where do they come from?

"Most architects talk past each other. In a sense, they are simply rivals competing for a part of the audience share." 



[Idea of discussion, group construction of reality, discourse...]






### Mannerism / Contrarianism
#### DSB / Everyday America + Kuhn

Social construction of what is good and what is bad.


The immense power of Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture and Learning From Las Vegas comes from not just their decision to face these objects, but their willingness to embrace them.

I feel sympathy with this idea. If everyone else goes left, my instinct is to go right.

"Blue skies research"


Charles Moore poses the compelling question that modern architecture spent very much time doing its best to ignore - what do we do with the spaces that we do not want, but that have come into existence nevertheless. "the commercial strip which they abhor has arrogated to itself more vitality, more power of growth, indeed more inevitability of growth, than the whole of their tidy output put together." 

"You will not be truly creative unless you are inspired by what is directly around you."

"Can't you architects hold off your criticism of strips and sprawl just long enough to find out why people use them?"

"my interest in architectural mannerism - breaking the rules, liking what's shocking"






### Nature
#### Rossi + 

"every region is distinguished from the wilderness in this respect: that it is an immense repository of labor....This land is thus not a work of nature; it is the work of our hands, our artificial homeland." -> 1491?

"to the extent that they are our 'artificial homeland' and objects have been constructed, they also testify to values; they constitute memory and permanence."







### Reading

### Misreading 

Um...


Just as we cannot read a building accurately, we cannot read a text. The meaning is lost as soon as it is written - in fact, the author does not even have control of the meaning of his work. In each moment, the meaning is transformed. We can perhaps push forward, or in a certain direction. 

What does it mean to understand a work of architecture? What does it mean to understand a text? Ultimately, all undestanding is only partial. No one will ever understand what Tafuri meant, not even Tafuri himself. 

We simply grab pieces, and re-deploy them in the service of our own beliefs, theories, etc.  We attend class, and our understanding is transformed in response to the teacher's own interpretation.

In discussions in this class, I do not remember much of the text that I have read (cf. understanding); in my life, most of the events that have made up my life are forgotten. We do not remember for long. Arguments become fragmentary. The act of writing presents a crystallization of a series of fragments of thought.

















### Recursion and Autonomy
#### Adolf Loos / Tafuri / Hofstadter

"At this point, as Victor Hugo realized so presciently in the 1830s, communication through the printed word, and lately through the mass media has released architecture from the role of "social book" into its specialized domain." 

This conclusion seems suspicious - architecture was once needed for this specific function, and now is freed from any requirements at all? This seems more self-justification than real analysis of the social role of architecture.



How does architecture justify itself? From where do we derive meaning?

One strategy for justifying architecture is to look outward. Hugo's famous essay, "This will kill that," in issuing an obituary for architecture, also provided a profound posthumous justification - architecture used to be for teaching the lessons of citizenship to an illiterate public. With the advent of literacy - to say nothing of the separation of church and state - this justification for architecture dissolves.

Since then, many justifications have centered around the idea of nature. Laugier proposed that architecture derives its forms from nature - the primitive hut - and that this is where [meaning comes from?] Le Corbusier transforms this argument to assert industry as a kind of nature substituted instead the idea of the machine (technology?) as the origin of form and meaning - a house is a "machine for living in", and architectural ideas should reflect the technological meaning of the time [refer to Loos].

Eisenman proposes a more abstract, formalist approach - architecture derives its meaning from the fundamentals of space itself - architecture is the exploration of the meaning of space (perhaps, but not necessarily, in regards to its relationship to human inhabitation.) Although certainly quite limited, excluding from its analysis much of the meat and meaning of human civilization, the closure of this kind of analysis is satisfying - we can fully explore the meaning of space through simple geometrical, algorithmical expression, perhaps forever. Tafuri's critique of this approach, however, is equally apt - this kind of approach is hermetical, and cannot accommodate the other aspects of architecture and human experience.

Tafuri proposes the idea of turning architecture upon itself as a mode of criticism - that architecture can criticize itself, that it can find meaning in its own history and theory. I am not exactly sure where this leads, or whether it is even a valid concept; I am sure that I do not understand it. [I need to reread some things to express an opinion here.]

This idea of self-reference has a compelling analogy in computer science - the concept of recursion. In computer science, recursion is seen as powerful and mysterious - it has the ability to vastly simplify many problems, but is difficult to control, and can easily exceed the grasp of the programmer. 

Does recursion open new avenues of computational power?





* Hofstadter / GEB



### Specificity | Significance
#### Rossi / Image of the City, Judd / Specific Objects


What does it mean to be a unique thing? How do we deal with this stuff?





Upon revisiting the piece, I was struck by Rossi's words about the specificity of the city: 
"there is something in the nature of urban artifacts that renders them very similar - and not only metaphorically - to a work of art." 
"a complicated entity which has developed in both space and time"
"the city is constituted as a totality and that this totality is its raison d'etre" [French geographers]
"there will always be a type of experience recognizable only to those who have walked through the particular building, street, or district"

And his powerful rhetorical question: "Sometimes I ask myself why architecture is not analyzed...in terms of its profound value as a human thing that shapes reality and adapts material according to an aesthetic conception."

One of the great privileges of doing architecture, at least in theory, is the opportunity to contribute to the creation of the physical record of humanity's existence.

One of the great burdens of architecture is the obligation to make those objects well. 










### Taste | Interpretation
#### Charles Moore / Plug It in, Rameses, and See if it Lights up.

How do we know what we like? I didn't always know I wanted to be an architect; when visiting places, I haven't always taken an architectural viewpoint. This means that I've visited some famous places [examples? Venice? Versailles? ] without being aware of why they were important, much less what the "correct interpretation" was. Now, presumably, I know better, and I regret these experiences, longing to return and revise my opinions towards what I now know to be "correct."

I was struck by this feeling while reading Charles Moore's "Plug It In, Rameses, and See if it Lights Up." This winter my wife and I visited California, and made the trip up the Pacific Coast Highway from Los Angeles to San Francisco, stopping at many of the sites Moore mentions.

We were underwhelmed by Santa Barbara - the Mission was a small colonial outpost, it did not have the monumentality that one hopes for such historical structures. The small building had been overwhelmed by the tourist-ization - it seemed that whatever aura the building might have once had was gone. The city itself was also disappointing - Moore speaks of the mythical Spanish history that the city has created for itself - we did not notice this, and saw instead a generic, Spanish-inspired California city. Perhaps the uniqueness of the stylistic choices have been overwhelmed by the spread of this style throughout the state. Unfortunately, we did not know to visit the City Hall.

In contrast, we spent a few days last winter in Santa Fe - before visiting we had learned the story of the city - town planners had decreed a Spanish mission style in the 1920's as a tourist attraction, and the friends we were staying with had spent a good amount of time fighting the board of planning to build their house with larger windows. The city seemed maudlin and vaguely absurd - the too-small windows, giant mansions pretending to be adobe huts - it was a transparent, inauthentic lie that seemed well past the time it should have been dissolved.

We also stopped along the way at the Hearst Castle. After pulling up at a giant parking lot, we entered a strange sort of lobby, and seeing the exorbitant prices and flocks of tourists, promptly turned around and left. Whatever Hearst Castle was, it was not going to be exciting.

We continued north, and reached our destination for the evening - the Madonna Inn. Nobody had told us to visit Santa Barbara, or the Hearst Castle, but two friends had independently told us to stay in the Inn.  We spent the night in the "What's Left" room - made up of leftovers from the decoration of other rooms - at the half-way point of our journey.  We knew that this place was also a tourist trap, but while the other places pretended to be something else - in this place we were in on the joke. Do you want to stay in the Caveman room, or the [other room]? You, the tourist, can stay wherever you want.

There is a kind of joy in reading that "Yes! The Madonna Inn really is architecture!" - and a kind of sadness in reading about the hilarious, glorious Santa Barbara City Hall, whose joke flew over your head. 

Our decisions of what is "good" and "bad" in architecture are profoundly important - we define the shape of the world through our designs, and our designs are shaped by the value we give to other ideas - "autonomy", "locus", etc.  Where do these feelings come from? What makes some good and some bad? What is the power of saying that this is good and this is bad?


















### Truth, Lies, Acceptance.
#### Upton + Rowe + Vidler

"The theoretical presumptions of modern architecture, located as they once were in a matrix of eschatological and utopian fantasy, began to mean very little when the technological and social revolution whose imminence the modern movement had assumed failed to take place." - Colin Rowe



Architecture students all lie. It is commonly accepted that the form justifies the argument - that if you have something that is attractive, and you can invent a justification, you have found something meaningful. It doesn't matter what path you took to this knowledge.

Are these lies? How do we deal with the knowledge that we are just making things up as we go along, for our own personal benefit? What happens when the day of reckoning arrives?

Colin Rowe and Dell Upton act as reckoners in their two articles, calling out old lies as an attempt to clear a new path for architectural practice and history, respectively. Rowe demolishes standard modern architectural theory - although the modernists made great promises for the utopian results of their work, they failed to change the world, and many ideas even had negative impacts. How do we employ modern architecture if its promises turned out to be hot air?

Dell Upton comes from a similar angle at architecture history, beginning from the practice's fundamental origin as a means of "legitimizing architects as professionals" - a practice which has from the beginning been involved more with ex-post facto justification than using research to drive practice.

Rowe's reaction to this fundamental compromise is to discard what is compromised and keep what is valuable - he claims the architectural forms themselves are valid and useful, and can now safely be extracted from their historical context and imbued with new (complementary?) meanings. Modernism "was an elaborately indirect mechanism for suppression of feelings of guilt," [self-justification] but if we confess this guilt, we can use the modern forms for new purposes.

Upton produces a different kind of answer; faced with the compromise of all of architectural history, it is necessary for Upton to propose a new, coherent basis for architectural research. Upton proposes the cultural landscape, rather than the individual artist or building, as the basic unit of inquiry. 

[REREAD THIS STUFF] 
He proposes a new approach to history where "its focus is the human experience of its own landscape, rather than the relationship of maker and object." While this architecture history would integrate the current discipline, it would be  "concerned with construction only on the way to construin
[REREAD THIS STUFF] 

Ultimately, Upton's goal seems to be to integrate architectural history into broader forms of knowledge, "relationship among human experience and the generation of meaning" 
"The boundaries among the humanities are dissolving" ... 

Upton closes his piece with a series of questions:
[quote this?]
can architecture be completely logical? must buildings have social goals (and how often)? what is the role of the architect in history? how to respond to the zeitgeist? how to use precedent? can radical architecture be popular and intelligible?

A similar set of questions in response to questions about the possibility of adequate meaning in architecture. The eventual destruction of all systems.












### Typology + Classification
#### Rowe / Third Typology
Alexander? Pattern Language?

How do we classify buildings?  Perhaps there are many ways, perhaps there is only one (typology). Formational rules / principles. Some of the clearest examples of typological research are by Eisenman. Permutation on a single idea.

For me, typology was the use of a building - the typology of the house, or the museum, or the factory.

There are too many words that fit under this category: "single/multi family", "compartmented/compact/continuous/composite", "landscape", "city block", "skyscraper", "palazzo" 

Perhaps the word itself has been ill-defined? 

Rowe defines typology in a broad sense - typology is the motivational origin of architecture. He describes two grand typologies that have "informed the production of architecture" since the 18th century - the first the idea of the primitive hut (and all that entails?), the second the idea of technology. 


Both of these motivations generate a class of forms.

Shifting idea of what typology represents.

"Nevertheless, a closer scrutiny reveals that the idea of type held by the eighteenth-century rationalists was of a very different order from that of the early modernists and that the third typology now emerging is radically different from both."

What do typologies do? They are formal rules that we define for kinds of spaces. Almost anything fits in here.

Typology is just a way of creating an interface between raw space / form and some set of requirements. The buildings (population?) that can be extruded through this interface are then the typology. 

"I would define the concept of type as something that is permanent and complex, a logical principle that is prior to form and that constitutes it." - Rossi

"The word type represent ... the idea of an element that must itself serve as a rule for the model." 

Typology seems, like much of the Italian work, to be only partially defined.
