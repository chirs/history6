### Remembering, Forgetting, Imagining

"At the origins of the critical act are always found the acts of distinguishing, separating, and disintegrating a given structure. Without the act of disintegrating the object under analysis, it is impossible to rewrite it." 

Memory is a process of construction. We do not store a complete memory in our brains, but fragments. When we remember, we reassemble the fragments that we have, and fill in the blanks. Every time we remember we create a new memory that displaces the old one. A memory is always an interpretation, a synthesis of fragments of original moment and what has been experienced before and after.

Memories exist in a kind of interface with the natural world. Memories lie dormant, waiting to be triggered, an thus remade; in the same way, memory resides in every architectural object, waiting to be read, interpreted.

What is the nature of the memory that is embedded in architectural space? It is a [pastiche?] Monuments project a kind of grand collective memory - they reflect values from a certain time, as perceived through modern eyes. They are in some ways the most honest and telling of the memory shards of the city, and in some ways the biggest liars.

This presents itself most clearly in the concept of the ruin - an object that is at once monumental and invisible. Sometimes, ruins retain fragments of memory - but, more interestingly, sometimes ruins become completely forgotten and reinvented. [Humayun's Tomb?]

What about the microscopic fragments? The potsherds, arrowheads, and refuse piles of architectural history? This can, in aggregate, tell us something - analysis can tell us what was eaten, what kind of kiln was used, contextualize entire bodies of information. On their own, however, they reveal little, allowing extrapolations that can be wildly incorrect.

For me, this idea conjures the idea of ruins - a ruin is the evidence of a forgotten civilization - and while we may believe that we can "read" and thus interpret the meaning of this object, we are almost certainly wrong. Our reading is contingent on our present circumstances, our goals and desires. 

And in fact all architectural objects are ruins. The Seagram Building holds a dramatically different meaning today than it did when it was constructed - the original meaning of the building is entirely inaccessible to modern eyes. We can perhaps catch glimpses of it, but the original meaning is lost, and our best hope is to reconstruct a story that is useful to ourselves (or myself, since my story will not have any relevance to you.)

There are fragments of his text that seem immensely valuable, but the thing itself is beyond my comprehension. What is the locus? We discussed it in class, but I've forgotten the answer.
