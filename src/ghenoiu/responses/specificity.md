### Specificity | Significance
#### Rossi / Image of the City, Judd / Specific Objects

And his powerful rhetorical question: "Sometimes I ask myself why architecture is not analyzed...in terms of its profound value as a human thing that shapes reality and adapts material according to an aesthetic conception."

One of the great privileges of doing architecture, at least in theory, is the opportunity to contribute to the creation of the physical record of humanity's existence.

What does it mean to unique? I am the only me.

Revisiting this piece, I was struck by Rossi's words about the specificity of the city: 
"there is something in the nature of urban artifacts that renders them very similar - and not only metaphorically - to a work of art." 
"a complicated entity which has developed in both space and time"
"the city is constituted as a totality and that this totality is its raison d'etre" [French geographers]
"there will always be a type of experience recognizable only to those who have walked through the particular building, street, or district"


One of the great burdens of architecture is the obligation to make those objects well.
