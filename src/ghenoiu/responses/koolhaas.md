### Junkspace Shmunkspace
#### Koolhaas 

What the fuck is junkspace? I read that whole essay and I couldn't make out a coherent argument. (To be honest, I didn't read the whole article. I skipped pages 6 and 7. I don't think it matters, maybe that's actually the point.) It's just a series aphorisms? 

Is "Junkspace" junkspace? Is Rem just generating more junkspace? Or maybe copying its form? Why are there no paragraphs? How do I read this text? Am I supposed to read junkspace the same way? 

I asked my classmates what junkspace was. Some had never heard of it. Most didn't have an answer. Mark told me that it was stuff like airport space where it all seems like it's the same thing. Somehow they are all united by air conditioning. Spaces that are all the same. If there there was junkspace before Rem described the idea, what was it? What was junkspace like before air-conditioning? What was the first junkspace, the primitive junk? What is junkspace's relation to junk space, aka the dump?

Is junkspace like junk food? If junkspace is the fallout of modernism, is junk food the fallout of capitalism? We can abstain from eating junk food. Should we? What do we do about it? What about junkspace? It seems unavoidable. We must consume junkspace. Space is not like food. 

Before people realized that junkspace was junkspace they called it megastructure. That's what Rem says at least. Maybe junkspace is all the leftover space we have in the world. Space that isn't architected? Or does that even matter? Space that architects can't handle. Architectural excess. 

Should we look at junkspace or avert our eyes? 

I talked to Craig and he told me that junkspace was non-place space. That it came from neoliberal capitalism's transformation of the whole world into the same space. Starbucks is junkspace. Hotels and airport lobbies are junkspace. Spaces that nobody inhabits, but everybody just passes through. The highway is junkspace. Traffic is junkspace. Maybe junkspace is the product of a profligate creation of space. 

I don't think "Junkspace" is junkspace. But maybe it's trying to evoke junkspace? Everything has some sort of meaning, but maybe not. Ideas are powerful, compelling, but don't quite fit together, but maybe they do. Junkspace is everywhere and nowhere at once. Everything is junkspace, until you look at it, and then it becomes real space. Maybe, maybe not, I'm not sure.

During our field trip I found out that Salvatore Ferragamo is junkspace. So is McDonald's. The place doesn't matter. The architecture is irrelevant, concealed, plastered over. Rem made some junkspace - they are called Prada stores. Maybe he made more. I'll let you know later.
