### Junkspace Shmunkspace
#### Koolhaas 

What the fuck is junkspace? I read that whole essay and I couldn't make out a single coherent argument. Maybe that's the point? Honestly I didn't read the whole article - I skipped pages 6 and 7. I don't think it matters - it's not like one idea follows from another. It's just a series of sentences. Aphorisms? What is the difference between junkspace and Junkspace? Are they the same? Two sides of the same coin? Is Rem just generating more junkspace? Or maybe he is copying its form? Why are there no paragraphs? How do I read this text? Is this how I am supposed to read Junkspace?
I asked my classmates what junkspace was. Most didn't have an answer. Mark told me that it was stuff like airport space where it all seems like it's the same thing. Spaces we've created that is under air-conditioning and that's all the same. Was there junkspace before Rem invented the idea? Before air-conditioning? 
Is junkspace like junk food? I think that's one analogy that he's drawing. If junkspace is the fallout of modernism, is junk food the fallout of capitalism? What do we do about it? We can abstain from eating junk food. Should we? What about junkspace? It seems unavoidable. Space is not like food. 
Before people realized that junkspace was junkspace they called it megastructure. Maybe junkspace is all the leftover space we have in the world. Space that isn't architected? Or does that even matter? Space that architects can't handle. Architectural excess. Is architectural megastructure really junkspace? Or is junkspace just what happens when we try to do megastructure? Or is junkspace just the only way that megastructure actually happens? 
Should we look at junkspace? Or avert our eyes? 
I talked to Craig and he told me that junkspace was non-place space. That it came from neoliberal capitalism's transformation of the whole world into the same space. Starbucks is junkspace. Hotels and airport lobbies are junkspace. Spaces that nobody inhabits, but everybody just passes through. Traffic is junkspace. The highway is junkspace. Junkspace is the product of a profligate creation of space. 
I don't think Junkspace is junkspace. But maybe it's trying to evoke junkspace? Everything has some sort of meaning, but maybe not. Ideas are powerful, compelling, but don't quite fit together, but maybe they do. Junkspace is everywhere and nowhere at once. Everything is junkspace, until you look at it, and then it becomes real space. Maybe, maybe not, I'm not sure.
