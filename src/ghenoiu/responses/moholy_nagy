Moholy Nagy / Native Genius in Anonymous Architecture

She looks for "genius" in anonymous architecture - "Each example shown in this book is characteristic but it is not necessarily the best in existence." The book is divided into three sections "expression of site and climate, ... form and function, ... materials and skills." answering the "where, why and how of anonymous architecture."

On page 19, Moholy-Nagy proposes a beginning of the history of architecture - as the "selection of means and meanings in deliberately planned environments" and shortly after describes the original causes - "diversity of form and function; economy of resources and upkeep; duration as material value and spiritual symbol." 



Moholy-Nagy's essay is an attack on over-homogenization of modern architecture. Her goal in this essay is to harness "anonymous architecture" for the use of modern architecture - to glean what can be learned from these buildings, and employ them in an enlarged understanding of modern architecture. She anticipates counter-arguments, saying that this kind of research will not be useful "to those who define architecture either as pure esthetics [Le Corbusier]...or those who consider it predominantly a branch of modern technology." 

Although she refers to Corbusier, she expends most of her ammunition on the engineering branch of architecture - exemplified by Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House, and tract housing in general ("boxes, held together by no more than Federal Loan Certificates."


Moholy-Nagy proposes a middle path (or an enlargement?) for architecture, architecture is "a challenge of responsible choices with the ultimate aim of coherence."

Moholy-Nagy is arguing for context in the practice of architecture, and it is hard to disagree with this sentiment.


"Both Moholy-Nagy and Rudofsky are interested in the vernacular as a resource for contemporary practice, but while Rudofsky limits his discussion to pre-industrial examples from exotic locales, Moholy-Nagy also includes the ordinary rural architecture of North America.
