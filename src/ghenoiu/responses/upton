Upton / Architectural History or Landscape History?


In his piece "Architectural History or Landscape History?", Dell Upton proposes a response to some fundamental criticisms of architectural history. 

The criticism asserts that architectural history is fundamentally biased and ill-defined. The history of architectural history is deeply entwined with the development and justification of architectural theory and design - it is a product of "architectural designers concerned with locating their works within the broad stream of tradition" with the social goal of "legitimizing architects as professionals"

Traditional architectural history assumes some of the biases of the 19th century period when it developed - "the discipline of architecture was to be socially defined and socially exercised." Upton identifies three models of understanding, the central concepts of "aesthetic universals, the individual work...as the unit of analysis, and the distinction between creator and audience" as the fundamental biases of architectural history.

Even attempts to escape this paradigm are inevitably structured by it. For example, the "study of vernacular architecture is deeply and inextricably entwined with that of high architecture." "Rather than denying or even supplementing the high culture, therefore, histories of the vernacular complete it."

Upton concludes his essay with a response to the fundamental biases of architectural history. He proposes the cultural landscape, rather than the individual artist or building, as the basic unit of inquiry. He proposes a new approach to history where "its focus is the human experience of its own landscape, rather than the relationship of maker and object." While this architecture history would integrate the current discipline, it would be  "concerned with construction only on the way to construin

Ultimately, Upton's goal seems to be to integrate architectural history into broader forms of knowledge, "relationship among human experience and the generation of meaning" 
"The boundaries among the humanities are dissolving" ...
