Upton / Architectural History or Landscape History?


Dell Upton's essay "Architectural History or Landscape History?" begins with an assault on the foundations of architectural history - the entire discipline is compromised and biased by its socio-historical origins. Upton concludes the text with a proposed response - reorienting architectural history towards to the object of the cultural response to the landscape - as a way to extract a new, enlarged architectural history that bridges the "boundaries among the humanities." 

The criticism asserts that the definition and assumptions fundamental to architectural history are badly defined. The history of 'architectural history' is deeply entwined with architectural theory and design - its motives entangled with the production and advertisement of architectural design - it is a product of "architectural designers concerned with locating their works within the broad stream of tradition" with the social goal of "legitimizing architects as professionals." 

Traditional architectural history assumes some of the biases of the 19th century period when it developed - "the discipline of architecture was to be socially defined and socially exercised." Upton identifies three models of understanding, the central concepts of "aesthetic universals, the individual work...as the unit of analysis, and the distinction between creator and audience" as the fundamental biases of architectural history.

Even attempts to escape this paradigm are inevitably structured by it. For example, the "study of vernacular architecture is deeply and inextricably entwined with that of high architecture." "Rather than denying or even supplementing the high culture, therefore, histories of the vernacular complete it."

Upton concludes his essay with a response to the fundamental biases of architectural history. He proposes the cultural landscape, rather than the individual artist or building, as the basic unit of inquiry. He proposes a new approach to history where "its focus is the human experience of its own landscape, rather than the relationship of maker and object." While this architecture history would integrate the current discipline, it would be  "concerned with construction only on the way to construin

Ultimately, Upton's goal seems to be to integrate architectural history into broader forms of knowledge, "relationship among human experience and the generation of meaning" 
"The boundaries among the humanities are dissolving" ... 

Questions include:
- specificity: Upton does not provide much detail about his new architectural history - how easy would this be to integrate
- choice: why is the landscape the new fundamental object? are there other possible choices? 
- other problems: Upton's choice of the landscape as the fundamental unit is an expression of his definition of the problems, as well as his sociologically consilient viewpoint. Are there other alternatives to this conception? How do they relate to each other? Why this one?
