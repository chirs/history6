### Reading

### Misreading 

Um...


Just as we cannot read a building accurately, we cannot read a text. The meaning is lost as soon as it is written - in fact, the author does not even have control of the meaning of his work. In each moment, the meaning is transformed. We can perhaps push forward, or in a certain direction. 

What does it mean to understand a work of architecture? What does it mean to understand a text? Ultimately, all undestanding is only partial. No one will ever understand what Tafuri meant, not even Tafuri himself. 

We simply grab pieces, and re-deploy them in the service of our own beliefs, theories, etc.  We attend class, and our understanding is transformed in response to the teacher's own interpretation.

In discussions in this class, I do not remember much of the text that I have read (cf. understanding); in my life, most of the events that have made up my life are forgotten. We do not remember for long. Arguments become fragmentary. The act of writing presents a crystallization of a series of fragments of thought.
