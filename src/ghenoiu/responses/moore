Charles Moore / Plug It in, Rameses, and See if it Lights up.

This winter my wife and I visited California, and drove up the Pacific Coast Highway from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Nobody recommended that I visit the Heart Castle, or the Missions along the way. We stopped at the Castle, but immediately turned around and left, as it was clear that it had been turned into a tourist trap. We spent a few minutes at the Santa Barbara Mission, but it likewise had been completely sterilized - it was not grand enough to maintain its power in the face of tourist-ization, and not campy enough to hold any interest. 

On the other hand, two of our friends separately recommended that we stay in the Madonna Inn, and so we spent the night in the "What's Left" room - made up of leftovers from the decoration of other rooms - at the half-way point of our journey. 

We found Santa Barbara stale and unappealing - as we did on a visit to Santa Fe last winter.  On our visit to Santa Fe, we knew already that the city's style had been established by the tourist board in the early 20th century;

sterility? falseness? knowledge? authenticity? 

was I correct?

"architecture of exclusion"

I am confused. Was I wrong? Am I wrong? Can I hold multiple opinions at the same time? Am I allowed to dislike Santa Fe or Santa Barbara for their falseness? Can I change my mind?


Moore poses the compelling question that modern architecture spent very much time doing its best to ignore - what do we do with the spaces that we do not want, but that have come into existence nevertheless. "the commercial strip which they abhor has arrogated to itself more vitality, more power of growth, indeed more inevitability of growth, than the whole of their tidy output put together."
