Mannerism / Contrarianism

DSB / Everyday America + Rowe?


Charles Moore poses the compelling question that modern architecture spent very much time doing its best to ignore - what do we do with the spaces that we do not want, but that have come into existence nevertheless. "the commercial strip which they abhor has arrogated to itself more vitality, more power of growth, indeed more inevitability of growth, than the whole of their tidy output put together." 

"You will not be truly creative unless you are inspired by what is directly around you."

"Can't you architects hold off your criticism of strips and sprawl just long enough to find out why people use them?"

"my interest in architectural mannerism - breaking the rules, liking what's shocking"
