A Country of Cities / Vishaan Chakrabarti

Chakrabarti presents a very straightforward argument in A Country of Citis - his basic assertion is that the higher the density of a place, the better it is, both in terms of livability and sustainability. If we are going to create an architecture that can supply the current world economic demands, we have to increase our densification.

The route to address this process is through zoning - the tide has already turned against the suburb, and what is now required is that zoning laws [etc] are changed to promote the new desired reality.

Techno-utopic vision of the future. Moving towards a steady state end goal.

Not addressing the psychological effects of living in these buildings. etc.

Allows that not everyone has to live in the dense cities, but does not describe alternate situations. How many people should live in the country? How should they be organized?
