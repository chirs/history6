#### Leon Krier / Peter Eisenman + Mark Wigley

Watching the Sanders / Clinton debate last night - and reflecting on the unusual political climate - I was reminded of Mark Wigley's critique of Eisenman and Krier as "simply two matching brands." We seem to be experiencing a political realignment, as Trumpism has brought to power a powerful nativist strain in the American body politic, while on the other side a self-declared socialist has come very close to the presidential nomination.

. And this shift reveals exactly how similar the two "sides" have been for so long, both accepting fundamental assumptions (rationality, globalization, etc.) - and critiquing the other's position within that set of assumptions. What Wigley says of Eisenman and Krier could equally be said of the Republicans and Democrats: "The positions are so symmetrical that there is no dissonance or exchange. Each side, in fact, adjusts to become the opposite of the other."



The Overton window the set of ideas that a group of people believe are politically acceptable - ideas outside of that are not taken seriously. Although invented to describe politics, the same idea applies to architectural thought (of course, architecture is also political).

During the time of Krier and Eisenman, their sides seemed like the only sides that matter, the only discussion worth having. Krier and Eisenman define themselves as rivals, opposite poles - but they are really just opposite sides of a single world-view that they continually confirm by their arguments. Every discussion that they have, every disagreement, legitimizes the fundamental assumptions that they both hold. While on one level they are opposites, from another angle they are exactly the same.

I wonder if this reveals a deeper problem with the idea of a dialectic. In order to have a discussion on a subject, we first must accept a set of ground rules. "The earth is round." "Global warming is happening." "Cause and effect exists." "We can communicate and reach conclusions through the exercise of reason." being a few examples. 


"Most architects talk past each other. In a sense, they are simply rivals competing for a part of the audience share."  This seems to be what is happening with Krier and Eisenman. What is the point of their discussions? Is anyone persuaded to one side or another? Does it even matter? What happens when one of them wins (maybe Eisenman won the architects, and Krier won the common people?) Presumably we set off on a new direction, examining new ideas. Maybe we can stay in the same place forever, debating the same old points. Maybe the whole point of the debate is just to sharpen both sides, to produce stronger arguments for the production of more precisely opposed, symmetrical buildings.

Is this what happened with the classical tradition for millenia? Is this the natural state of architecture? Of discourse? How do we know when we can quit arguing? When do we move on? Do we declare a winner, or do we just declare the game invalid because the rules were wrong in the first place?

Thomas Kuhn, in his book "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," describes science undergoing radical paradigm shifts - long periods of relatively inactivity, or scholasticism - can give way very quickly to bursts of transformation as one set of paradigms is replaced by the other. The analogy to architecture is clear - the Eisenman/Krier paradigm superseded the postmodernist, which superseded the Modernist. Where are we now? Where are we headed? What assumptions that Eisenman and Krier took to be fundamental were overthrown (by Rem?) What assumptions do we hold now, and which of these is most vulnerable? What are the foundations of our edifice, and how can they be undermined? The project of architectural theory consists not of building a grand theory, but tearing apart the theories that we do have, looking more and more deeply until we have found the final axioms that our architecture must rest on. Maybe once we find them, we can destroy them as well.
