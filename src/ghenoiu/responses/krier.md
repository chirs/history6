Krier / Eisenman.

"The positions are so symmetrical that there is no dissonance or exchange. Each side, in fact, adjusts to become the opposite of the other."

Watching the Sanders / Hillary debate last night, I was reminded of Mark Wigley's critique of Eisenman and Krier as "simply two matching brands."

The "Overton window" describes a social pyschological construct of "the range of ideas the public will accept." We in the early 21st century United States occupy a certain sector of this window - the architecture students at Pratt, certainly, a different one than their parents, etc.

The persistent power of Trump this semester makes me wonder about the function of rhetoric.

Define new ideas? Where do they come from?

"Most architects talk past each other. In a sense, they are simply rivals competing for a part of the audience share."
