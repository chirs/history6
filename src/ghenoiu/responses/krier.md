#### Leon Krier / Peter Eisenman + Mark Wigley

Watching the Sanders / Hillary debate last night - and generally reflecting on our strange current political climate - I was reminded of Mark Wigley's critique of Eisenman and Krier as "simply two matching brands." We are (it seems) experiencing some sort of political realignment, as Trumpism is bringing to light a powerful populist (nativist) strain in the American body politic. And this shift reveals exactly how similar the two "sides" have been for so long, both accepting fundamental assumptions (rationality, globalization, etc.) - and critiquing the other's position within that set of assumptions. What Wigley says of Eisenman and Krier could equally be said of the Republicans and Democrats: "The positions are so symmetrical that there is no dissonance or exchange. Each side, in fact, adjusts to become the opposite of the other."

The Overton window describes a subset of ideas that are socially (politically) acceptable - ideas outside of that - eg communism in 20th century US - are not taken seriously. Krier and Eisenman define themselves as rivals, opposite poles - but they are really just opposite sides of a single world-view that they continually confirm by their arguments. Every discussion that they have, every disagreement, legitimizes the fundamental assumptions that they both hold. While on one level they are opposites, from another angle they are exactly the same.

"Most architects talk past each other. In a sense, they are simply rivals competing for a part of the audience share."  This seems to be what is happening with Krier and Eisenman. What is the point of their discussions? Is anyone persuaded to one side or another? Does it even matter? What happens when one of them wins (did Eisenman win?) Presumably we set off on a new direction, examining new ideas. Maybe we can stay in the same place forever, debating the same old points. Maybe the whole point of the debate is just to sharpen both sides, to produce stronger arguments for the production of more precisely opposed, symmetrical buildings.

Is this what happened with the classical tradition for millenia? Is this the natural state of architecture? Of discourse? How do we know when we can quit arguing? When do we move on? Do we declare a winner, or do we just declare the game invalid because the rules were wrong in the first place?
