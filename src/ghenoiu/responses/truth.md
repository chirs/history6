### Truth, Lies, Acceptance.
#### Upton + Rowe + Vidler

Modernism "was an elaborately indirect mechanism for suppression of feelings of guilt,"

"The theoretical presumptions of modern architecture, located as they once were in a matrix of eschatological and utopian fantasy, began to mean very little when the technological and social revolution whose imminence the modern movement had assumed failed to take place." - Colin Rowe

Architecture students lie often, and well. It is a skill we learn quite early. First, you must create so mething that is beautiful, powerful; then, you must find a way to justify it. How you got there doesn't really matter. 

Truth is arbitrary, unreliable. What matters is what we make, the things hold their own truth, perhaps.

Are these lies? How do we deal with the knowledge that we are just making things up as we go along, for our own personal benefit? What happens when the day of reckoning arrives?

Colin Rowe and Dell Upton act as reckoners in their two articles, calling out old lies to clear a new path for architectural practice and history, respectively. Rowe demolishes standard modern architectural theory - although the modernists made great promises for the utopian results of their work, they failed to change the world, and many ideas even had negative impacts. How do we employ modern architecture if its promises turned out to be hot air? Dell Upton comes from a similar angle at architecture history, beginning from the practice's fundamental origin as a means of "legitimizing architects as professionals" - a practice which has from the beginning been involved more with ex-post facto justification than using research to drive practice.

Rowe's reaction to this fundamental compromise is to split architecture in two - one part meaning, the other part form.

to discard what is compromised and keep what is valuable - he claims the architectural forms themselves are valid and useful, and can now safely be extracted from their historical context and imbued with new (complementary?) meanings.  If we confess our sins, we can be absolved to use the modern forms for new purposes.

Upton produces a different kind of answer; faced with the compromise of all of architectural history, it is necessary for Upton to propose a new, coherent basis for architectural research. Upton proposes the cultural landscape, rather than the individual artist or building, as the basic unit of inquiry.

He proposes a new approach to history where "its focus is the human experience of its own landscape, rather than the relationship of maker and object." While this architecture history would integrate the current discipline, it would be  "concerned with construction only on the way to construin

Ultimately, Upton's goal seems to be to integrate architectural history into broader forms of knowledge, "relationship among human experience and the generation of meaning" 
"The boundaries among the humanities are dissolving" ... 

Upton closes his piece with a series of questions:
[quote this?]
can architecture be completely logical? must buildings have social goals (and how often)? what is the role of the architect in history? how to respond to the zeitgeist? how to use precedent? can radical architecture be popular and intelligible?

A similar set of questions in response to questions about the possibility of adequate meaning in architecture. The eventual destruction of all systems.
