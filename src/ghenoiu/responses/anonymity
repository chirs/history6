Identity? / Anonymity? / 
Moholy Nagy / Native Genius in Anonymous Architecture + Rudofsky / Architecture without architects

Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, a decade before Bernard Rudofsky, interrogates "anonymous architecture" to discover new architectural truths - their methods and results, however, are quite different. Rudofsky looks at "architecture without architects" to discover beautiful new forms, "primitive" architectural patterns that is somehow more "alive" and exciting than austere modernism. Moholy-Nagy, on the other hand, uses anonymous architecture to inform a deeper practice of modern architecture. 

Essentially, her argument is about context. The book is divided into three sections, each related to a different contextual feature: "expression of site and climate, ... form and function, ... materials and skills." answering the "where, why and how of anonymous architecture."

Moholy-Nagy's essay is an attack on over-homogenization of modern architecture. She anticipates counter-arguments, saying that this kind of research will not be useful "to those who define architecture either as pure esthetics [Le Corbusier]...or those who consider it predominantly a branch of modern technology." Although she refers to Corbusier, she expends most of her ammunition on the engineering branch of architecture - exemplified by Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House, and tract housing in general ("boxes, held together by no more than Federal Loan Certificates."

"Both Moholy-Nagy and Rudofsky are interested in the vernacular as a resource for contemporary practice, but while Rudofsky limits his discussion to pre-industrial examples from exotic locales, Moholy-Nagy also includes the ordinary rural architecture of North America.

On page 19, Moholy-Nagy proposes a beginning of the history of architecture - as the "selection of means and meanings in deliberately planned environments" and shortly after describes the original causes - "diversity of form and function; economy of resources and upkeep; duration as material value and spiritual symbol." 

Ultimately, while Rudofsky may be making claims for an "inclusive architecture" - Moholy-Nagy is working precisely within the traditional doctrine of modernism. She looks for "genius" in anonymous architecture - "Each example shown in this book is characteristic but it is not necessarily the best in existence." - and she hopes that this genius allows us to find genius in our standard modern architecture.

Moholy-Nagy proposes a middle path (or an enlargement?) for architecture, architecture is "a challenge of responsible choices with the ultimate aim of coherence."
