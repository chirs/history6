### Typology + Classification
#### Rowe / Third Typology (Alexander?)

How do we classify buildings?  Residential vs. commercial. Classical vs. modernist. Urban vs rural.

Perhaps there are many ways, perhaps there is only one (typology). Formational rules / principles. Some of the clearest examples of typological research are by Eisenman. Permutation on a single idea.

For me, typology was the use of a building - the typology of the house, or the museum, or the factory.

There are too many words that fit under this category: "single/multi family", "compartmented/compact/continuous/composite", "landscape", "city block", "skyscraper", "palazzo" 

Perhaps the word itself has been ill-defined? 

Rowe defines typology in a broad sense - typology is the motivational origin of architecture. He describes two grand typologies that have "informed the production of architecture" since the 18th century - the first the idea of the primitive hut (and all that entails?), the second the idea of technology. 


Both of these motivations generate a class of forms.

Shifting idea of what typology represents.

"Nevertheless, a closer scrutiny reveals that the idea of type held by the eighteenth-century rationalists was of a very different order from that of the early modernists and that the third typology now emerging is radically different from both."

What do typologies do? They are formal rules that we define for kinds of spaces. Almost anything fits in here.

Typology is just a way of creating an interface between raw space / form and some set of requirements. The buildings (population?) that can be extruded through this interface are then the typology. 

"I would define the concept of type as something that is permanent and complex, a logical principle that is prior to form and that constitutes it." - Rossi

"The word type represent ... the idea of an element that must itself serve as a rule for the model." 

Typology seems, like much of the Italian work, to be only partially defined.
