Tafuri / L'architecture dans le Boudoir

Rossi and Tafuri both read as much like poets as theorists to me. 

Like Rossi, I don't feel like I understand Tafuri. (Perhaps it is something about the Italians.) Tafuri speaks about this very act of undestanding, dismantling, disassembling, reintegrating. 

What does it mean to understand a work of architecture? What does it mean to understand a text? 

Ultimately, all undestanding is only partial. No one will ever understand what Tafuri meant, not even Tafuri himself. 

We simply grab pieces, and re-deploy them in the service of our own beliefs, theories, etc.  We attend class, and our understanding is transformed in response to the teacher's own interpretation.



What then, do I understand from Tafuri? What is my re-contextualization of his work?  I don't know, I think I at least need one more reading to even begin to formulate a response. 



"At the origins of the critical act are always found the acts of distinguishing, separating, and disintegrating a given structure. Without the act of disintegrating the object under analysis, it is impossible to rewrite it." 



Memory / forgetting.

We do not remember for long. Arguments become fragmentary. 

re-reading.
