simulation, fiction, virtuality
Eisenman / End of the Classical

"Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time."

The integration of the computer and architecture has brought digital simulation close to the fingertips of every architecture student. Our rendering process revolves around simulations - some more precise, some less - of a physical world operating along certain laws. Likewise, we are capable of simulating environmental factors - daylighting, solar heat gain, etc.; transit simulations dictate when and where roads are built.

We approach these simulations by judging their accuracy - are they "close enough" to the reality that we are trying to represent? Sometimes we feel that the simulations are "too real" - that they make some artistic choices more difficult while over-specificizing what is an ambiguous future reality.

Eisenman approaches the idea of a simulation from the opposite side - from a philosophical rather than computational perspective, and looking at simulations as half-lies rather than almost-truths.

Eisenman claims that architecture has historically operated under a series of fictions, and that the break that modernism claimed to represent - and represented in other art forms - failed to deal with these fundamental problems. These fictions are: representation, reason, and history. Whereas architecture may have at one point been able to transmit meaning through orders, representation no longer carries meaning because we no longer believe in the classical orders the way we used to.

The second is the idea of reason - whereas architecture originally derived its authority from its relationship with the divine, and later substituted science into the place of the divine, a more thorough inspection of the apparatus that produces "knowledge" 

"The processes for knowing - measurement, logical proof, causality-turned out to be a network of value-laden arguments, no more than effective modes of persuasion."

* Alternative fictions

"alternative fictions for the origin can be proposed: for example, one that is arbitrary, one that has no external value derived from meaning, truth, or timelessness."

What if the Nazis won World War II? What if the meteor didn't hit Earth 65 million years ago? What if Vitruvius's De Architecture was lost to history? What if modern architecture had developed out of Islamic or Indian architecural theory rather than Western? What if architecture was founded on ugliness?

What is the use of the simulation? What is its relationship to truth and falsehood?



Eisenman deals very delicately with the idea of fiction in his piece "The End of the Classical," wherein he busts apart modernism, claiming that it was never even really present in the first place.

"Thus to proceed from "error" or fiction is to counter consciously the tradition of "mis-reading" on which the classical unwittingly depended-not a presumedly logical transformation of something a priori, but a deliberate "error" stated as such, one which presupposes only its own intemal truth."

"What can be the model for architecture when the essence of what was effective in the classical model-the presumed rational value of structures, representations, methodologies of origins and ends. and deductive processes-has been shown to be a simulation?"



"The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors/functions of the selected physical or abstract system or process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time."
