### Recursion | Self-reference
#### Adolf Loos / Tafuri / Hofstadter


Through much of its history, architecture has searched outside of itself for justification. Traditional narratives have looked to the beginnings of civilization, to the idea of a natural order from which architecture has emerged, as a justification for the choices that architecture makes. More recent (modernist) critiques have rejected nature as the source of architectural value, and have substituted instead the idea of the machine (technology?) as the origin of form and meaning - a house is a "machine for living in", and architectural ideas should reflect the technological meaning of the time [refer to Loos].

Eisenman proposes a more abstract, formalist approach - architecture derives its meaning from the fundamentals of space itself - architecture is the exploration of the meaning of space (perhaps, but not necessarily, in regards to its relationship to human inhabitation.) Although certainly quite limited, excluding from its analysis much of the meat and meaning of human civilization, the closure of this kind of analysis is satisfying - we can fully explore the meaning of space through simple geometrical, algorithmical expression, perhaps forever. Tafuri's critique of this approach, however, is equally apt - this kind of approach is hermetical, and cannot accommodate the other aspects of architecture and human experience.

Tafuri (I believe) proposes the idea of turning architecture upon itself as a mode of criticism - that architecture can criticize itself, that it can find meaning in its own history and theory. I am not exactly sure where this leads, or whether it is even a valid concept; I am sure that I do not understand it. [I need to reread some things to express an opinion here.]

This idea of self-reference has a compelling analogy in computer science - the concept of recursion. In computer science, recursion is seen as powerful and mysterious - it has the ability to vastly simplify many problems, but is difficult to control, and can easily exceed the grasp of the programmer. At the same time, it is one of th emost beautiful aspects of the field, and can produce many results that are impossible without it.
