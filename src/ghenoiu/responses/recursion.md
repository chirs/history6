### Recursion and Autonomy
#### Adolf Loos / Tafuri / Hofstadter

"At this point, as Victor Hugo realized so presciently in the 1830s, communication through the printed word, and lately through the mass media has released architecture from the role of "social book" into its specialized domain." 

This conclusion seems suspicious - architecture was once needed for this specific function, and now is freed from any requirements at all? This seems more self-justification than real analysis of the social role of architecture.



How does architecture justify itself? From where do we derive meaning?

One strategy for justifying architecture is to look outward. Hugo's famous essay, "This will kill that," in issuing an obituary for architecture, also provided a profound posthumous justification - architecture used to be for teaching the lessons of citizenship to an illiterate public. With the advent of literacy - to say nothing of the separation of church and state - this justification for architecture dissolves.

Since then, many justifications have centered around the idea of nature. Laugier proposed that architecture derives its forms from nature - the primitive hut - and that this is where [meaning comes from?] Le Corbusier transforms this argument to assert industry as a kind of nature substituted instead the idea of the machine (technology?) as the origin of form and meaning - a house is a "machine for living in", and architectural ideas should reflect the technological meaning of the time [refer to Loos].

Eisenman proposes a more abstract, formalist approach - architecture derives its meaning from the fundamentals of space itself - architecture is the exploration of the meaning of space (perhaps, but not necessarily, in regards to its relationship to human inhabitation.) Although certainly quite limited, excluding from its analysis much of the meat and meaning of human civilization, the closure of this kind of analysis is satisfying - we can fully explore the meaning of space through simple geometrical, algorithmical expression, perhaps forever. Tafuri's critique of this approach, however, is equally apt - this kind of approach is hermetical, and cannot accommodate the other aspects of architecture and human experience.

Tafuri proposes the idea of turning architecture upon itself as a mode of criticism - that architecture can criticize itself, that it can find meaning in its own history and theory. I am not exactly sure where this leads, or whether it is even a valid concept; I am sure that I do not understand it. [I need to reread some things to express an opinion here.]

This idea of self-reference has a compelling analogy in computer science - the concept of recursion. In computer science, recursion is seen as powerful and mysterious - it has the ability to vastly simplify many problems, but is difficult to control, and can easily exceed the grasp of the programmer. 

Does recursion open new avenues of computational power?
