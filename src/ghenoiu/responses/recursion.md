### Recursion and Autonomy
#### Adolf Loos / Tafuri / Hofstadter

How does architecture justify itself? From where do we derive meaning?

Recursion in computer science, is the ability of a process to reference itself. It is regarded by programmers as one of the most powerful and mysterious techniques. (It cannot, however, do anything that a non-recursive program can; it adds no power, but often adds beauty.)

"At this point, as Victor Hugo realized so presciently in the 1830s, communication through the printed word, and lately through the mass media has released architecture from the role of "social book" into its specialized domain." 

This conclusion seems suspicious - architecture was once needed for this specific function, and now is freed from any requirements at all? This seems more self-justification than real analysis of the social role of architecture.





One strategy for justifying architecture is to look outward. Hugo's famous essay, "This will kill that," in issuing an obituary for architecture, also provides a profound posthumous justification - architecture used to be for teaching the lessons of citizenship to an illiterate public. With the advent of literacy - to say nothing of the separation of church and state - this justification for architecture dissolves.

Eisenman proposes a more abstract, formalist approach - architecture derives its meaning from space itself - architecture is the exploration of the meaning of space (perhaps in regards to its relationship to human inhabitation.) Although excluding from its analysis much of the meat and meaning of human existence, the closure of this kind of analysis is satisfying - we can fully explore the meaning of space through straightforward geometrical, algorithmical expression, perhaps forever. Tafuri's critique of this approach, however, is equally apt - this kind of approach is hermetic, and cannot accommodate the other aspects of architecture and human experience.

Tafuri proposes the idea of turning architecture upon itself as a mode of criticism - that architecture can criticize itself, that it can find meaning in its own history and theory. I am not exactly sure where this leads, or whether it is even a valid concept; I am sure that I do not understand it. [I need to reread some things to express an opinion here.]
