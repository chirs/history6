Rowe / Third Typology


I think I have long misunderstood (or overly diminished) the idea of typology. For me, typology was the use of a building - the typology of the house, or the museum, or the factory.

Rowe defines typology in a larger sence - typology is the motivational origin of architecture. He describes two grand typologies that have "informed the production of architecture" since the 18th century - the first the idea of the primitive hut (and all that entails?), the second the idea of technology. 

Both of these motivations generate a class of forms.

Shifting idea of what typology represents.

"Nevertheless, a closer scrutiny reveals that the idea of type held by the eighteenth-century rationalists was of a very different order from that of the early modernists and that the third typology now emerging is radically different from both."

"I would define the concept of type as something that is permanent and complex, a logical principle that is prior to form and that constitutes it."
