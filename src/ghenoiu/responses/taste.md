### Taste | Interpretation
#### Charles Moore / Plug It in, Rameses, and See if it Lights up.

How do we know what we like? I didn't always know I wanted to be an architect; when visiting places, I haven't always taken an architectural viewpoint. This means that I've visited some famous places [examples? Venice? Versailles? ] without being aware of why they were important, much less what the "correct interpretation" was. Now, presumably, I know better, and I regret these experiences, longing to return and revise my opinions towards what I now know to be "correct."

I was struck by this feeling while reading Charles Moore's "Plug It In, Rameses, and See if it Lights Up." This winter my wife and I visited California, and made the trip up the Pacific Coast Highway from Los Angeles to San Francisco, stopping at many of the sites Moore mentions.

We were underwhelmed by Santa Barbara - the Mission was a small colonial outpost, it did not have the monumentality that one hopes for such historical structures. The small building had been overwhelmed by the tourist-ization - it seemed that whatever aura the building might have once had was gone. The city itself was also disappointing - Moore speaks of the mythical Spanish history that the city has created for itself - we did not notice this, and saw instead a generic, Spanish-inspired California city. Perhaps the uniqueness of the stylistic choices have been overwhelmed by the spread of this style throughout the state. Unfortunately, we did not know to visit the City Hall.

In contrast, we spent a few days last winter in Santa Fe - before visiting we had learned the story of the city - town planners had decreed a Spanish mission style in the 1920's as a tourist attraction, and the friends we were staying with had spent a good amount of time fighting the board of planning to build their house with larger windows. The city seemed maudlin and vaguely absurd - the too-small windows, giant mansions pretending to be adobe huts - it was a transparent, inauthentic lie that seemed well past the time it should have been dissolved.

We also stopped along the way at the Hearst Castle. After pulling up at a giant parking lot, we entered a strange sort of lobby, and seeing the exorbitant prices and flocks of tourists, promptly turned around and left. Whatever Hearst Castle was, it was not going to be exciting.

We continued north, and reached our destination for the evening - the Madonna Inn. Nobody had told us to visit Santa Barbara, or the Hearst Castle, but two friends had independently told us to stay in the Inn.  We spent the night in the "What's Left" room - made up of leftovers from the decoration of other rooms - at the half-way point of our journey.  We knew that this place was also a tourist trap, but while the other places pretended to be something else - in this place we were in on the joke. Do you want to stay in the Caveman room, or the [other room]? You, the tourist, can stay wherever you want.

There is a kind of joy in reading that "Yes! The Madonna Inn really is architecture!" - and a kind of sadness in reading about the hilarious, glorious Santa Barbara City Hall, whose joke flew over your head. 

Our decisions of what is "good" and "bad" in architecture are profoundly important - we define the shape of the world through our designs, and our designs are shaped by the value we give to other ideas - "autonomy", "locus", etc.  Where do these feelings come from? What makes some good and some bad? What is the power of saying that this is good and this is bad?
