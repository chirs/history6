### Taste | Interpretation
#### Charles Moore / Plug It in, Rameses, and See if it Lights up.

Lots of people believe architects are out of touch - that the opinions of architects are out of synch with the people they are building for. 

[How does a non-architect view and interpret?]

How do we know what we like? I didn't always know I wanted to be an architect; when visiting places, I haven't always taken an architectural viewpoint. This means that I've visited some famous places [examples? Venice? Versailles? ] without being aware of why they were important, much less what the "correct interpretation" was. Now, presumably, I know better, and I long to return with my current knowledge, to appreciate the places I did not understand, to evaluate things more correctly, to understand more fully.

I was struck by this feeling while reading Charles Moore's "Plug It In, Rameses, and See if it Lights Up." This winter my wife and I visited California, and made the trip up the Pacific Coast Highway from Los Angeles to San Francisco, stopping at many of the sites Moore mentions.

We were underwhelmed by Santa Barbara - the Mission was a small colonial outpost, it lacked the monumentality that one desires for such historical structures. The small building had been overwhelmed by the tourist - whatever aura the building might have once had dissipated. The city itself was also disappointing - Moore speaks of the pseudo-historical Spanish history that the city has constructed for itself - we did not notice this, and saw only a generic, Spanish-inspired California city. Perhaps the uniqueness of the stylistic choices have been overwhelmed by the spread of this style throughout the state. Unfortunately, we did not know to visit the City Hall.

In contrast, we spent a few days last winter in Santa Fe - before visiting we had learned the story of the city - town planners had decreed a Spanish mission style in the 1920's as a tourist attraction, and the friends we were staying with had spent a good amount of time fighting the board of planning to build their house with larger windows. The city seemed absurd - giant mansions with tiny windows pretending to be adobe huts - it was a transparent, inauthentic lie that seemed well past its time.

[condense to one sentence] We stopped along the way at the Hearst Castle. After pulling up at a giant parking lot, we entered a strange sort of lobby, and seeing the exorbitant prices and flocks of tourists, promptly turned around and left. Whatever Hearst Castle was, it was not going to be exciting.]

We continued north, and reached our destination for the evening - the Madonna Inn. Nobody had told us to visit Santa Barbara, or the Hearst Castle, but two friends had independently told us to stay in the Inn.  We spent the night in the "What's Left" room - made up of leftovers from the decoration of other rooms.  We knew that this place was also a tourist trap, but while the other places pretended to be something else - in this place we were in on the joke. Do you want to stay in the Caveman room, or the [other room]? You, the tourist, can stay wherever you want.

There is a kind of joy in reading that "Yes! The Madonna Inn really is architecture!" - and a kind of sadness in reading about the hilarious, glorious Santa Barbara City Hall, whose grandeur flew over my head. 

**[Our decisions of what is "good" and "bad" in architecture are profoundly important - we define the shape of the world through our designs], and our designs are shaped by the value we give to other ideas - "autonomy", "locus", etc.  Where do these feelings come from? What makes some good and some bad? What is the power of saying that this is good and this is bad?
