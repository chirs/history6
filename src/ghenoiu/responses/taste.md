### Taste | Interpretation
#### Charles Moore / Plug It in, Rameses, and See if it Lights up.

This winter my wife and I visited California, and drove up the Pacific Coast Highway from Los Angeles to San Francisco.  We stopped first in Santa Barbara, to see the Mission, and the famously fancy city. 

We were underwhelmed by the Santa Barbara Mission - a small colonial outpost, it did not have the monumentality that one hopes for such historical structures. The small building had been overwhelmed by the tourist-ization - it seemed that whatever aura the building might have once had was gone. The city itself was also disappointing - Moore speaks of the mythical Spanish history that the city has created for itself - we did not notice this, and saw instead a generic, Spanish-inspired California city. Perhaps the uniqueness of the stylistic choices have been overwhelmed by the spread of this style throughout the state. Unfortunately, we did not know to visit the City Hall.

In contrast, we spent a few days last winter in Santa Fe - before visiting we had learned the story of the city - town planners had decreed a Spanish mission style in the 1920's as a tourist attraction, and the friends we were staying with had spent a good amount of time fighting the board of planning to build their house with larger windows. The city seemed maudlin and vaguely absurd - the too-small windows, giant mansions pretending to be adobe huts - it was a transparent, inauthentic lie that seemed well past the time it should have been dissolved.

We also stopped along the way at the Hearst Castle. After pulling up at a giant parking lot, we entered a strange sort of lobby, and seeing the exorbitant prices and flocks of tourists, promptly turned around and left. Whatever Hearst Castle was, it was not going to be exciting.

We continued north, and reached our destination for the evening - the Madonna Inn. Nobody had told us to visit Santa Barbara, or the Hearst Castle, but two friends had independently told us to stay in the Inn.  We spent the night in the "What's Left" room - made up of leftovers from the decoration of other rooms - at the half-way point of our journey.  We knew that this place was also a tourist trap, but while the other places pretended to be something else - in this place we were in on the joke. Do you want to stay in the Caveman room, or the [other room]? You, the tourist, can stay wherever you want.

I must admit, that upon reading Moore's praise for Santa Barbara, I was a little disappointed in myself. Had I missed something? Was I wrong - too serious, too demanding of authenticity? Should I change my mind? maybe I can convince myself that I actually liked Santa Barbara after all...

I guess this is a question of taste? I think I need to reach some sort of conclusion.
