A repository for the two history courses I am taking this semester.  Erik Ghenoiu and Thomas Leeser

This will be an attempt to combine and guide my experience of this course, towards a targeted end.

### Adolf Loos

Give a presentation about Adolf Loos for the 2nd week of Leeser's class.

Outline

In general I'm going to try to organize everything around Ornament + Crime, since that really seems to be what Loos is famous for and helps situate the modern situation I think.

So I'll start with discussing a bit about Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau, in particular the Vienna Secession, maybe a few examples of Hoffman, Olbrich.

Then, I will run through a couple of Loos's argumentative strands (modern bourgeois vs. craftsman; texture as ornament vs "modern" ornamentation (art nouveau); ideas about industry, progress; economic/international aspects).

Then I'll try to aim towards a discussion of how

1. Loos is relevant to modern architecture theory (questions of postmodernism, parametricism, style, ...)
2.  why we still read him today (universal argument; early voice of modernism; provocative...)
